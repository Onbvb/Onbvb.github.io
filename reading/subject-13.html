        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            Subject is a small box containing a deck of cards, these cards are similar to those found in a standard Riderâ€“Waite Tarot deck.<br>
            These cards have a higher than normal efficacy when used for Cartomantic reading.<br>
            Testing procedures have resulted in 4.11% of readers dying, the cause of which is unknown.

            <p>
                Note: Testers were instructed to do a three-card spread, while focusing on the near future.
                Some tests have been removed for brevity, for a full list, please contact the Archives Dept.
