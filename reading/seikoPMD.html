            "Ahhhh... My head hurts..."<br>
            I slowly opened my eyes, despite the pounding headache and mild aching all over my body. All I really wanted to do was go back to sleep and let this blow over, but I couldn't find the will to rozll back over. As I blinked off the last dregs of sleep from my mind, I realized I was lying on the ground, in a forest. This definitely didn't feel like somewhere I would fall asleep willingly. In fact, I didn't recognize the forest at all. "Why... Where..." I muttered to myself, as I stood up and looked around. I couldn't place my surroundings, but I was in a small forest clearing, with some odd stone ruins in the center. "...Who builds something in the middle of a forest?" I tried walking over, only to have my hind legs give out. Wait. Hind legs? I hadn't thought about it before, but I definitely hadn't gone to sleep as a quadruped... How did I know that? Why would I be <em>able</em> to differentiate going to sleep as a quadruped or not? What was happening? No. There wasn't time to think about that. I just had to take things in stride until I figured out basic survival. There was likely shelter, with the ruins, and I could hear a river somewhere nearby, which figured out water. Did I... need water? I wasn't entirely sure. Maybe I photosynthesized? I decided to go towards the river, just in case. That is, after I steadied myself. Focus. Survival first, worry about the existential dread of being in an unknown place with odd instincts later.<br>
            <br>
            As I reached the river and went to drink, my reflection startled me. It was that of a pink cat-like animal, which felt... wrong, somehow. I couldn't pin it exactly, but some part of me said it was wrong. I couldn't remember <em>why</em> it'd feel wrong, in fact, I couldn't remember... anything. Why couldn't I remember anything? What was happening? I wake up in an unfamiliar location, with a 'wrong' body, lacking all memories. What is going on? Where am I? What am I? Who am I? My breathing quickened. Everything felt like it was happening at a fever pitch. My heart was pounding my mind was racing oh god what was happening did i die what where- And then a thought popped into my head. <strong class="corpus">What is the optimal way to teleport a soup can across a large enough distance such that it heats to perfect temperature upon arrival?</strong> My thoughts ground to a halt. Teleport a soup can? What? You can do that?? Then, I remembered I didn't have shelter. Focus. Survival first.<br>
            <br>
            I ended up going into the ruins I had found upon waking up, and I found a small room with a working water fountain. I searched the other rooms and eventually found a somewhat intact cushion filled with feathers. The ruins felt familiar, in a way. Lots of rooms with many tiers, facing one central location. As I dragged the cushion to my makeshift room, I remembered to actually drink from the fountain, since I hadn't drunk from the river. I hadn't managed to find any food, and I definitely felt that in the hunger. It was overwhelming, but I had ran around the woods and ruins a lot, and the sun was setting, so I decided to go to sleep, and find food tommorow.<br>
            <br>
            ==<br>
            <br>
            I consulted my map. I had left the previous town around a day ago, and was deep in the forest. I was scanning the map for something interesting between this town and the next, and something caught my eye. A small note next to a drawing of ruins that read 'Here be monsters!' which intrigued me. I've always been the type to explore old ruins, and the threat of monsters just made the deal all the sweeter. As I started to head off in the proper direction, I wondered to myself what could possibly have caused the seller of the map, an imposing Probopass, to write this. Honestly? It was fairly stupid, but stupidity is just courage that hasn't caught up.<br>
            <br>
            A day or so later, I was nearing the spot on the map, or, so I hoped. It was then that a subtle voice wormed its way into my subconscious, telling me to stay away and run far, far, away. That there was a great and terrible monster here and that it was hungry. A message so subtle that only my predisposition against psychic influence caught it. This message was likely what turned the map seller away, and it made sense that nobody else had come to this place in a while. Any normal pokémon would fall for the message, and any pokémon more sensitive to the message would note how subtle it was, and realize that only a skilled psychic-type could make it. Unfortunately for me, I am driven by curiosity, courage, and sense, in that order. I ignored the message and kept making my way towards the ruins. I unconsciously changed my form to that of a psychic-type, Xatu, as the form I was wearing, a Floragato, is not a form that had any chance to recognize and ignore that message.<br>
            <br>
            Within the day, I reached the ruins, a run-down facility built into the ground, the voice had only grown louder as I had approached the facility. I wasn't, myself, a psychic-type, so I couldn't entirely block it out, but I could ignore it enough to be able to fight and move. I opened one of the old doors, and slunk deeper into the facility, passing room after room, each with an unknown purpose, known only by their long dead users. As the voice in my head got louder and louder, it suddenly stopped when I reached the end of a hall. As I opened the door, it revealed a small pink form, curled and sleeping. Upon closer inspection, it was an Espeon, and a slightly emaciated one at that, they must not have been eating well. There was a fountain in the corner of the room, assumedly where they had gotten water, but besides those, not much else was in the room. I cleared my voice and spoke, "Hey, are you OK?". They stirred, the gem on their forehead an unusual purple, instead of the red typical of their species. Their right front leg was purple, and, upon closer inspection, it seemed to be made of some purple crystal not dissimilar to the gem in their forehead. They opened their eyes and stood up, looking at me, but their eyes were... vacant, hungry, almost. I felt a strong pull on my mind, as they readied to run at me. Of course, I immediately ran the other direction, retracing my steps to the entrance of the ruins. I heard them running behind me, almost beastial in form and posture. As I managed to get out of the main door and slam it behind me, it suddenly wrenched off of the wall with the sound of metal tearing and rock cracking. The door was hurled at me, and I barely dodged the rusted hunk of metal. It crashed into a tree behind me with a crack, and the Espeon immediately started readying another attack, all the while that pulling at my mind was ceaseless. It felt somewhat like a Munna or Musharna eating a dream, but this was occurring while I was awake. I dodged the next hurled object, this time a chunk of rock from a wall of the ruins, while I tried to figure out what was happening. All I had in my bag were my rations, tent, maps, and some interesting stones I'd found in my wandering. None of that would be helpful to me now, except maybe the rocks, as I could throw them at the Espeon. I didn't want to hurt them, because they didn't seem like they were in their right mind, but a rock probably wouldn't hurt. I dodged the next hurled object, a chunk of dirt, and grabbed a rock from my bag, an odd purple gem that looked similar to the Espeon's gem and leg. I had found it with some others in the last town, and bought them, as the designs that were trapped in the crystals were mesmerizing to look at. I hurled it at them, missing wildly, but their attention turned towards the gem as it flew past, and they pounced on it, letting their next attack, the mangled mass of wood, metal, and rock that must've been the tree the door crashed into, fall to the ground. The pulling sensation on my mind suddenly ceased, and I moved towards them to observe what was happening.<br>
            <br>
            The Espeon was hunched over the gem, and it was slowly disappearing. They looked notably healthier with each passing second, their eyes, when I was able to see them, no longer had that vacant, predatory look to them, and they started looking around wildly, seemingly confused as to how they got here. "Are you... okay?" I asked, mildly hesitant. "AAAAH!" They screamed, "Who are you? Where am I? What happened?" Their breathing quickened, their eyes getting more frantic. Their breathing was erratic, and they froze in place. It felt similar to when I saw an Eevee going through a panic attack, must be something shared between all Eeveelutions. "Do you know the way to the Bubblegum Mines?" I asked. "Do I... wha? Huh?" Their breathing steadied, and their eyes stopped flicking around wildly. "You were having a panic attack." I stated, "What are you doing, out in some ruins in the middle of the woods?" They blinked, still somewhat confused. "I was... using it as shelter?" They responded, after a significant pause. "Sorry, the last thing I remember is going to sleep, and then I'm outside, hunched over some sort of crystal, with a strange animal near me." "... Animal? I'm not some wild beast, I'm a perfectly respectable Pokémon!" They seemed mildly confused at my reaction, before something flickered over their face, and they responded. "I... guess you are? What is happening??" They had muttered the last part under their breath, assumedly I wasn't supposed to hear it. "Let's... start over. Hello, I am known as The Drifter, what's your name?" Better to get off on the right foot, no? "I am... Seiko?" "Why'd you say that like you're unsure? Also Psycho? Like Psycho Cut?" They paused, visibly thinking. "I only just now remembered my name, and it's spelled Seiko, not Psycho." "That's an odd name, and you just now remembered your name?" They peered off into the forest. "Why don't we continue this inside? There's a fountain with relatively clean water in there." They grabbed the tiny remains of the gem, and started towards the vacant doorway. With nothing better to do, I followed.<br>
            <br>
            "So. What happened? As I said, I only remember going to sleep, and then coming to outside." They had drunk some water, and set the small remains of the gem in a corner. "Well, I stumbled across these ruins, and when I came inside, you were on the cushion over there, asleep. I tried to get your attention, and see if you were OK, but then you started chasing after and attacking me with telekinesis. You looked like a wild animal. I ended up throwing a gem at you, which you then... ate? I'm not entirely sure what happened there, and then you came back to." They were taken aback. "I did what? I... don't remember any of that." They were visibly thinking, a bit shook. "I... don't remember anything. Why can't I remember?" It felt like they would slip into a panic again, so I interjected. "Hey. Breathe. You're a psychic-type, you should be able to examine your memories. Just focus on them and let your instincts guide you." They were a bit calmer, and they closed their eyes. I wasn't a psychic type myself, so I couldn't see what they were going through.<br>
            <br>
            == <br>
            <br>
            I closed my eyes, as the Drifter instructed, and turned myself inward. Almost immediately, I found myself in a library. It was a grand library, with polished purple wood shelves, and black stone floor tiles. I pulled a book off the shelf with- I realized I had arms, the right one still made of that purple crystal. A voice, behind me, spoke. <span class="corpus">"When you are working with mental constructs, especially those inside your head, you will end up seeing yourself in your own self-image. I, for example, would retain my arm made of amethyst."</span> I whirled around, but the speaker wasn't there. It had sounded similar to... my voice. It wasn't important, probably. I leafed through the book, and it was a memory of me talking to The Drifter, and ended with me closing my eyes. The pages had... amethyst woven into them somehow. I put the book back and started wandering the shelves, looking for any other memories. A lot of shelves categorized after the one I had started at had books that were empty or not there, reserved for future memories. There were amethyst gems on some orangeish metal floating and providing light. I retraced my steps to where I began, and started in the opposite direction. When I turned the corner, I was confronted by... nothing. There were no earlier shelves. The earliest memory I had in my library was of waking up. I walked into the empty space, and there was a single tome, in a random spot. I ran over to it and started flipping through it, but it was the same memory that triggered when I heard the word "Pokémon", of who I can only assume to be me, scratching a pink catlike creature, likely the same type of creature I was now, behind the ears with my amethyst arm. The memory, at least here, held a lot more information than it had when it triggered earlier. Apparently, I was the caretaker and friend of the... Espeon, the word occurred to me. I was her friend and caretaker. This memory had traces of... confusion? It was focused at my right arm. I couldn't glean anything more from the memory, and it left me with more questions than it answered, but... the complete lack of shelves was more important. It felt like there should be ash here, if anything. <span class="corpus">"Memories can be burnt, overwritten, even, but never annulled."</span> The voice said, in time with my thoughts. I asked aloud, "Who... are you?" but... the voice was silent. It felt... absent. I looked around for any more recovered memories, and found two pages, one that defined amethyst, and noted it as an... ethical food source? That was odd, but I supposed I had consumed the amethyst that The Drifter had thrown at me. The other just had my name, Seiko. I wandered the library a bit more, and came across a small empty room, where I set the recovered book and page, and then I... simply exited the library. All it really took was me thinking about leaving.<br>
            <br>
            The Drifter had moved over to the fountain, and was drinking from it. They'd set their bag in a corner, and had set out some rations near me, it was meat of some sort, assumedly smoked. I looked at them, and they had helped me greatly, but I couldn't shake the feeling that they were an enemy. "Do you know any Pokemon that can... remove memories?" I asked. "I can't, but many psychic-type Pokemon can." They answered. "What are types? You keep mentioning them, and I have no clue what you're talking about." They turned from the fountain to me, and began explaining. "Effectively, types are categories for Pokemon and moves that roughly divide them based on characteristics and interactions. And, before you ask, moves are just a category containing attacks and the like." I took a second to think. "So, what type are you?" They responded, after a second, "Psychic and Flying." Which could be true, but something in me doubted that. It wasn't rational, but... some instinct I had doubted that the pokemon in front of me had psychic abilities. "Then... use some psychic abilities. I could use the pointers, given I've no clue how to use any moves." They paused for a second. "I could, but I'm personally terrible at it. Moreso a flying-type user." Something in me pushed... deeper. It seeked out their mind and attempted to read their thoughts. I hadn't done it consciously, but I wasn't complaining about possible information on someone I felt uneasy about. As the tendril of psychic energy attempted to pierce their thoughts, it suddenly failed, winking out of existence. "I do have a question," I said, "What types are strong against psychic?" They looked at me, responding with practiced tone, "Psychic types are weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark types." before something visibly clicked in their mind, and they paused again. "I notice that neither flying nor psychic are in that list. I couldn't read your mind, y'know, and it wasn't because of psychic pushback." My mind was putting together pieces I wasn't entirely aware of, and the vague unease I had against them felt more justified. "So, which of the three are you?" I asked, my voice sharp. They paused, before their form wavered and shifted, revealing a small black foxlike creature with a purple bandana around their neck. "Dark." They responded. "But I don't like telling people, since they usually assume dark-types are evil." The sight of the form they had assumed felt... familiar. It felt like I should recognize it. Suddenly, another memory bubbled to the front of my mind, of an anthropomorphic black fox, like The Drifter's new form, but bigger, in a tailored suit, wielding two dark knives and dodging arrows fired by an anthropomorphic bird. Neither figure felt aggressive, in fact, they both felt... familiar, like strong and reliable allies. My unease towards the drifter faded as the memory dissipated. "I... see. Do you know what type a Mind-Reading move would be? Is that even considered a move?" They transformed back into the birdlike form they had met me in, the same purple bandana, which I hadn't noticed before, tied around one of their wings. It was a very different form to the bird I had seen in my memory. They reached into their bag, and pulled out a small book, the title of which read 'Moves, a comprehensive guide.', "Try to find it somewhere in here, but I'd assume it'd be psychic." I looked at them, with a flat expression. "I don't have hands." "Ah, but you can use Telekinesis, no?" "That was while I was... what was I?" I entered my library, briefly, and looked at the book that should cover that timeframe. It was erratic and indistinct, other than a sense of h u n g e r. It was overwhelming, and I quickly reshelved the book, exiting my library. "...starving, apparently." "That makes sense, as you seemed to consume the crystal that I threw at you." "So I... eat gems. That explains the blurb about ethical food sources..." They paused, quizzical look on their face, and asked "Ethical... food source? Huh? Where'd you see that?" I explained a bit about what happened when I entered my mental library, leaving out the voice that spoke to me. "Hmm. So you're... not really a pokemon? Is that even... possible?" They were curious, now. "That's what my memories would suggest." "So... what were you?" "I can't remember, but I know I was bipedal, and, now that I eat gems." I responded, "There's probably something else, since you becoming a..." The name suddenly occured to me. "Zoroark? triggered a memory in me." They sighed. "Zorua, which evolves into Zoroark, but close. Anywho, you're a pure psychic-type, so you should have similar instincts for using Telekinesis." I gestured towards the smoked meat. "Oh, before I forget, what is this meat?" They took another small piece of meat from their bag, and started eating. "Smoked fish, because I assumed you might be hungry." The fish went flying across the room, without any thought from me. Some part of me was... afraid of the fish, despite it being inanimate. "Not a fan of fish?" They asked. "I don't know... I didn't do that, I think." They chuckled. "Well, focus on what happened, maybe revisit that book, and see what you did, even unconsciously." I focused on the memory, not entering my library, and interrogated what, exactly, I even did. It felt... odd. When I looked at it, I couldn't see anything, but I remembered how I saw a tendril of energy when I attempted to read their mind. I focused on <em>that</em> memory, instead, trying to see as I saw in that memory. Suddenly, I could see... mist, focused around The Drifter's head as they gathered the thrown rations. It was blurry, indistinct, and amethyst-colored. When I looked at it, a flurry of feelings welled up in my head, among them, hunger, relief, and the feeling that I could... use? whatever it was. "What are you doing? Your forehead gem and eyes have started glowing purple." The Drifer asked, pulling something out of their bag. "I... don't know? I see... a mist?" I... reached out to it, not physically, but mentally. As I did, a similar mist, floating around my head, coalesced into a tendrillike form, and it grabbed a section of the mist around their head, absorbing it in an instant. "Can you... not do that? It feels... like a Musharna attack, I guess." They were writing in a small journal, looking up at me now and again. I felt slightly more sated after I did that. It was an odd feeling, as I hadn't eaten anything, but felt more full nonetheless. I stopped concentrating on the tendril, and it dissipated back into the mist hovering around my head. With this knowledge in hand, I closed my eyes and focused on the memory again, viewing it through this new lens, and I saw myself form not a tendril, but a hand, which scooped up the meat and hurled it away from me, surprisingly fast for how sedate my tendrils had moved. I opened my eyes and focused on the shape of the hand, trying to will the mist around my head into such a shape. It shattered as soon as it touched the book. Manipulating this mist- A thought suddenly popped into my head, now recognizable as coming from the same voice in my library, <strong class="corpus">This... is Media. Psychic or Mental energy, if you like. It is-</strong> The voice cut off abruptly, as if the larger sentence wasn't relevant. Manipulating the <em>media</em> in the air felt like trying to move water with just a sieve. "Do you know any psychic moves? How does it feel to use them?" The Drifter, not looking up from their journal, replied, "Well, I've used Extrasensory, which feels like using... hm. It feels like using the <em>concept</em> of a weapon to attack the target." The voice added to that, <strong class="corpus">When working with thoughts, and</strong> The portion here was garbled, indescipherable. <strong class="corpus">it is often better to imply then to outright define.</strong> I was getting a better read on the voice, and it felt like someone teaching others, sharing knowledge. I tried again, but instead of focusing on the exact manipulation of the hand, I formed it and thought about the intended goal, to pick up the book and start flipping pages. The hand wavered, but it picked up the book, feeling more solid as it did, and struggled to open it. I formed another hand, and they started flipping through the book. I drunk in every single move and its description at rapid pace. "Are you... actually remembering anything? You're speeding through those pages." The Drifter had closed their journal and looked up, before reopening the journal and beginning to write something, looking up now and again. "I... am, I think. I could probably recall it if I need to." I wasn't consciously interpreting the material, but I remembered it, nonetheless. I reached the end of the book, and set it down. The Drifter closed their journal again, and picked up the book, flipping to a random page. "Tell me the typing, effects, and max uses of Burning Jealousy." It came to the front of my mind almost immediately. "Fire, damages all opponents within short range, and will burn anyone who has been buffed recently. Can be used around 5 times without rest." The Drifter flipped to another page, and read out another move name, which I answered in a similar fasion.<br>
            <br>
            They ended up calling out 10 moves in all, of which I only stumbled on one, due to two moves that sound very similar. "Well I'll be, you really did memorize that in minutes. It took me years to even memorize the moves I could learn." They rubbed their forehead with a wing. "It all got copied into my library, I guess." The Drifter looked at me with a sort of envy. "That would've helped a lot when I was learning what I could do. Why couldn't I have a photographic memory?" I laid down, a bit tired. "I'm going to take a second and examine that memory I got, the one with the zoroark, there should be another cushion somewhere in this facility, if you'd like it." The Drifter started towards the door, exiting into the hall and dissapearing around a corner. I closed my eyes and focused on the library, entering it without incedent, and made my way towards the empty area, searching for the book I knew would have been revealed with the flash of memory earlier. I found it and immediately scooped it up and started towards the small room I had found earlier. I really wished I had a chair and desk, to read the book with, and when I had that thought, suddenly there was a plush armchair and writing desk in the room, where there hadn't been before. It took me a second, but I remembered the voice had called this place a 'Mental Construct', which I supposed meant my thoughts were tangible things, here. I set the book on the desk, and moved the other book and pages from the floor into one of the drawers in the desk. I went over to the shelves that were still standing, and saw the moves book on the shelf, as it was in the real world. It was fully copied, and since it was a book, it must've been just put on the shelf. I grabbed it and returned to my reading room, before scanning over the first memory. It didn't give me much outside of what I had seen, but I was struck by the thought that the bird, a Decidueye, was improving in his archery, and that I should push him towards shooting while upside-down, which was... odd. It suggested that I was an authority on archery, but I couldn't remember being one. I set it in the drawer, and started scanning through the book, looking for any move that would let me read minds. I found it under M, Mind Reader. It noted that the type, despite it being a move that interacted with the mind, was normal, instead of psychic. I exited my mental library, and took a drink of water, despite not being entirely certain I needed it. The Drifter pulled a cushion into the room. "It's getting close to nighttime, we should sleep." They went over to their bag and pulled out another amethyst, tossing it onto my makeshift bed. "I have a couple of these, so you don't go hungry and throw more trees at me." "Question, what types are immune to normal moves?" They replied "Ghost, why?" I looked at them, with a bit of anger in my tone. "Because Mind Reader is a normal-type move. Not psychic. So you aren't a Zorua." They paled, gulping. "I... why isn't it psychic?" "Again, I couldn't read your mind. What are you, really?" A telekinetic hand moved over to the door and closed it. The Drifter sighed, and their form started to bubble and morph, appearing to shrink into that of a Zorua. "You aren't a Zorua. Try. Again." "You're... not exactly wrong, but you aren't right, either." Their form stopped changing, solidifying into a white Zorua, with whispy pink tips to their fur. "I <em>am</em> a Zorua, but I'm a Hisuian Zorua." My tone was flat. "And your type?" They chewed on the purple bandana around their neck nervously. "Normal and Ghost..." They were somewhat shrinking back. "And why would you lie to me? Once, I can get, you have your reasons, but twice? Why?" "I... we... I uh... you... theres..." They were stammering, trying to form a sentence. They took a breath and steadied themselves, standing straighter and no longer cowering, their nervousness melting away. "Hisuian Zorua are... few and far between. We're seen as bad omens, like Absol, and usually are the target of suspicion and anger, if not outright hate. Regular Zorua aren't seen much better, due to being dark-type, but they usually get by without people blowing up at them by finding some niche, but Hisuian Zorua are so rare that we usually get chased out on sight." The story felt... familiar, somehow. I empathized with them on an instinctual level. It felt like I had been through something similar, but I wasn't certain. I looked at the psychic energy in the air, and realized I was unconsciously targeting them with a lot of hostile energy, made to make me look more imposing and dangerous than I was. I dissipated that and then spoke. "I... don't know why, or how, but I understand on some level. I might be able to say more if I had my memories, but some part of me resonated with that." I removed the hand holding the door closed. "You should've been honest the first time, but I understand why you would lie." They shook themselves, and then adopted the form of a Decidueye. "We... should probably go to sleep. I... am sorry for lying to you." They moved towards their cushion, laying down on it. I moved over to mine, and moved the amethyst next to it, laying down and drifting off to sleep.<br>
            <br>
            It was closing in. It had deflected my arrows. My spells fizzling. It had managed to lock down my form, so I couldn't transform to get out of here. Where was Lance? He was supposed to hit this thing with a bolt by now. I couldn't feel his mind around me. I activated my ring, but the energy it released was dissipated by the monster chasing me. My hand went to the bracelet connected to an identical one that Lance wore, but it wasn't there. I had given it to him to fix the filigree and he hadn't managed to get it back to me before we had to fight in this odd place. All I could do was run, run until my legs gave out. It stripped off my helmet, wrenching it off of my body. I put the rest of my armor back into my Klein storage, to lighten myself, then I tried, in a last ditch effort, to reach out to its mind and consume it, but the beast behind me had nothing but an empty void. It consumed me, sending me into a dark, dark, dark place. Devoid of all senses, and soon enough, devoid of my thoughts.<br>
            <br>
            I woke in a cold sweat. I had dreamt of... something. Something dark, horrible. I couldn't recall any details, but it shook me to my core. I looked around the room, breath quick and unsteady, before I realized where I was. The ruins, with The Drifter across the room, scratching in their journal. I steadied myself, and looked at the amethyst I had set next to my cushion, which had shrunk to the size of a seed. They looked over at me. "You're awake? Good. We should get moving, otherwise I'll run out of food." They closed their journal, and stood up, their purple bandana tied around their leg. "I'd really prefer we travel together, since you know my secret, but I understand if you don't want to." They sounded sad. "I'd also prefer we travel together, since you're the only Pokemon I know at the moment." They brightened, a little, and tossed a bandana to me. "Since we're going to be travelling together, I'd really appreciate if you wore this, so others know you're with the 'Drifter's Guild'." I used telekinetic hands to pick up the bandana and tie it around my neck. "I apparently really like purple. From the amethyst, to the wood, to this bandana." "Purple stands out, and people usually take it as a unique guild bandana, since none of the established guilds use purple. I have at least fifteen different memberships noted for a guild that doesn't exist!" I used one of the hands to grab the amethyst seeds, and The Drifter walked towards the door, offhandedly asking me a question. "By the way, what's your gender? Espeon don't have any outward differences, so I've no clue how to refer to you." The question caught me a bit off-guard, with how utterly normal it was. "I'm... a guy, you?" "I never really identified with either, to be honest." A piece of a memory flashed through my mind, the Zoroark I knew also didn't identify with either. "Odd coincidence." "Hm?" They asked. "Oh, the Zoroark from that memory I told you about feels similarly." I replied. "Well, it might be something with the shapeshifting." We emerged into the daylight and fresh air. "Could you hold these for me? I'd rather not devote some of my attention to carrying them." I moved the seeds over towards them, and they grabbed them and put them in their bag. "I'm buying you a bag in the next town." They pulled out a map and compass, and started off in a direction after looking at them for a minute. "This should be the right way, cmon." I followed them into the woods.<br>

            ==<br>
            <br>
            My head was pounding, and my gut ached. I stood up, sluggishly, and immediately collapsed back down to the sand. I felt myself drifting, the comforting sound of the waves lulling me asleep. I felt so heavy.<br>
            <br>
            I wasn't getting a signal from any of the others. My hand went to the band around my right wrist, before I remembered its twin was in my pocket. I was on my own, I had to improvise. I threw my javelin blindly behind me and sped up. I had to get away from this fight. Nothing had worked. That <em>thing</em> had just absorbed or deflected everything I threw at it. I felt something pierce my gut from behind, pinning me to the ground. I looked down and saw the very same javelin I'd thrown as a last ditch effort, its copper surface stained crimson with my blood. I felt something grip my head from behind-<br>
            <br>
            I jolted awake. I was in an unfamiliar location, surrounded by three figures. A bright light was on above me, blinding me. My heartbeat quickened, and electricity arced off of my body, hitting the figures surrounding me. One of them staggered back a bit, but the other two were unaffected. I looked around, trying to get a bearing on my surroundings. "You were right to get Alto out of here." One said. "Told ya they'd be confused." The other responded, before turning to me. "Hey, bud. Calm down, we aren't going to kill you. Samuel here found you when he was out on the beach looking for..." My breathing slowed a little, my heart stopped racing. The figure turned to the other one. "What were you lookin' for, again?" My eyes refocused, adjusting to the light. The figures, which had been indistinct, clarified into a dust-brown snake, a muddy horse, and a leafy, green reptile. "I was looking for seaweed for Alto, apparently she wants to try cooking with it." The snake, who I assumed was Samuel, replied. "Huh, bet that'd make an interesting soup. Anyways, Samuel found you on the beach, and saw you collapse when you tried to stand up. He came and got me and Kai, and we moved you into this spare house." The light I had seen earlier was a window, letting in sunlight. The reptile, who was likely Kai, walked back over, and started speaking. "Me and Alto have been taking care of you while you slept, so maybe don't hit me with a lightning bolt next time." They walked, a bit stiffly, out of the house. "Don't mind him, he's just annoyed at the electrician's guild, which tends to bubble over onto other electric-types, sometimes." The horse told me, "So, what is up with you? Why're you on a beach somewhere, passed out?" Samuel was in my face, asking question after question. My throat felt rough as I tried to speak, but my first attempt devolved into a coughing fit. "Here, drink some water." Samuel used his tail to hold a small bowl of water to my mouth, I drunk deeply, which soothed the scratchy pain in my throat. Samuel moved the now empty bowl back to a small table, and I began to speak again. "I..." My words caught in my throat. I couldn't remember anything before waking up. The only memory I had was my name. "I can't... remember..." The horse called out of the door, "Alto? They have amnesia." Samuel was still in my face, his body resting on me. "What do you remember? Is any of it related to your odd coloring?" He had a hungry curiosity in his eyes. "I... know that my name is Lance, and that I'm a guy..." Samuel was nodding along, "So, you have no clue why you're orange?" I stood up, shaking Samuel off, and took a good look at myself. He was right, I was orange, and when the light caught my fur, it shimmered like metal. I was still a bit dizzy, but I was getting better by the second. "No, I don't." As Samuel snickered to themselves, a bird covered in what looked like a cloud walked into the small house, and the horse exited. "Hi, I'm Alto, You can't remember anything?" She had a shockingly powerful voice for a smaller animal. Samuel slithered over to the door, and exited the building as well. "That's right." She hopped over to me, looking me over. "Well, I can't give you a psychiatric evaluation, I'm more of a doctor, but you look fine physically. Do you feel Dizzy? Sick? Anything ache?" She hopped around me, looking intently. "Uh... no, I feel fine, thank you." She hopped infront of me. "That's good. You should be moving around, since you were asleep for at least a day. I'm sure that Dale can show you around the village, and I'll try to get someone who can give you a basic rundown of everything, since you don't remember anything. I'll also try to get a psychic type here from the medic's guild to see if they can't help with your memory." She hopped towards the door, and gestured for me to follow, before hopping out of the small house.<br>
            <br>
            I exited the house, and the horse, who I was fairly certain was Dale, was waiting outside for me. Alto had flown off, and I could see her landing on another house, poking her head in before taking off and flying off into the distance. "Well, you heard the doc, I'll be showing you around Appleton." He trotted off, away from the rest of the houses. "That was... I guess, your house, as long as you stay here. It's on town center, so if we ever have a massive gathering or somethin', it'll be right outside your door." I was following him, easily keeping pace. He turned and started towards a grove of trees. "Over here are our apple trees, which we harvest and sell to the merchant's guild or the drifter's guild, when they show up. Our usual Kecleon is nice, you'll probably meet them sooner or later." He began to gallop through the trees, weaving through them in a practiced dance. I was barely able to keep pace with him, almost running into a few trees, and tripping over more than a couple roots. "Here, on the other end of our orchard, is a recent addition." There were... structures, arranged in rows. "These are courtesy of the electrical guild, those snakes." He muttered the last part under his breath. "They installed these here solar panels, and connected them up to an automatic apple press, but somethin' broke the day after they left, and we don't have any electric types in the village. Most of the travellers that've come by have refused to work on it, too." He stomped one of his hooves, annoyed. I looked at the panels, curious. "I know you don't remember anythin' but maybe bein' an electric type, you can glean somethin' from em." "I mean, I can try." "Tryin's all that matters." I circled some of the panels, looking for... I wasn't quite sure. "Do you know if these open?" I asked, since maybe the problem was internal. I was guessing, really, but... it felt right, somehow. Dale trotted over to a broken panel, to the side of all the others. "We managed to take apart one of the busted ones they accidentally left behind, if that works." I went over to him, and started examining the panel. "Well, this one isn't connected to the others, right?" "It isn't, why?" "I can see how one is structured, internally, but this doesn't help me see what, if anything, is wrong with any of the others." The structure of wires inside the panel was... comforting, somehow. It was a tangle of wires, but something about it... I shook the thought away, and kept examining it. "I guess that makes sense, I'll get Kai out here tommorow, He's always been good at takin' things apart and seein' what makes 'em tick." I stepped away from the panel. "Yeah, if he could take one apart out here with me tommorow, that would be great." The words coming out of my mouth didn't entirely make sense to me. I didn't know what I was doing, did I? I couldn't remember anything about electronics, let alone solar panels, but it felt like I should. My paws were... twitching, when I held them over the mess of cables it seemed almost like they knew what to do. "Well, That's the tour, really. We're a small community." As we started to walk back towards the houses, I asked, "You mentioned a couple guilds, which I assume are... groups of people? Two of the ones you mentioned have their purpose right in their name, but what's the drifter's guild?" "Well, they're a strange one, them. We get 'em rarely, maybe once every couple seasons, but it's always a different Pokemon, always solitary. We only know they're apart of the same guild because they all wear a purple bandana. They usually show up and do odd jobs or explore the dungeons around our village. They're pretty helpful when they appear." I assumed Pokemon was the actual term for all of the animals I'd been talking to. "What's so significant about a bandana?" I asked. "Well, guilds usually have a single design for bandanas that they give out to their members, to signify they have the backing of said guild. You can find a list of 'em if you head off to Market Town, which is a couple days away for everyone but Alto. She can usually get there within the hour. There's a guild for all kinds of things, really." He paused, and shook his head. "There even used to be a adventurer's guild, but they've fallen apart due to infighting. They used to give their rescue teams unique kerchiefs that signified their achievements, and some of the best teams had custom designs." His tone felt... somber, as if he was reminicing on a lost friend. "I see." We walked back to the main village in silence.<br>
            <br>
            When we got back, Alto swept me back into my house, where there was a pokemon who taught me for the rest of the day about types and matchups and other things, it even bled into the next day, my teacher leaving about when Dale showed up to my house and stuck his head in. "Hey, Lance, Kai is free enough to take apart one of the panels for you, cmon." I exited my house, and started following him past the orchard, over to the solar panels, where Kai was stood over one of them. "Do you want me to just open it?" He asked, with a bit of animosity in it. "That would be wonderful, yes." I replied, and he started using one of the leaves on his hands to unscrew bolts that were invisible to the naked eye. He deftly took off the back metal cover and set it aside. "Ta-da." He said, voice flat. "Is this one of the ones that isn't providing power?" I asked, studying the inside of the panel. "Well, none of 'em are providin' power, really." Dale replied. I had unconsciously moved my paw to where a wire terminated, so I looked closer at it. The wire had come undone from the main board. "Well, this connection needs to be resoldered, but if everything is down, then it might be a problem outside of the panels." I had no clue what solder was, and it felt like my body spoke the words before my brain could check them. "Do you have something to test panels in isolation, like a light or something?" I had begun tracing the wire that came out of the panel, following it as it joined up with the other panels' wires into a box. "Also, could you open this, Kai? Thank you." Dale responded to my earlier question while Kai worked on the box. "I could see if we do, give me a moment." He galloped off towards the village, leaving me and Kai alone. He didn't attempt any small talk, so I didn't either. He popped off the cover of the box, and I moved in to examine it. "Hm..." I had no real clue what I was looking at, but it felt wrong, somehow. The wires were a mess, so I began to straighten them. Maybe, if the box was cleaner, I could figure out what was happening. I felt some of the wires shock me, releasing an audible crack, but nothing really happened. "Hm. I thought electric-types were only resistant to electricity." Kai mused behind me. I kept straightening out the incoming wires, plugging and unplugging them as needed, until I could trace all of them without having to move any others. Nothing looked... broken on this side, so I went to the other side of the box. "Nothing on that side, could you open this one, please?" Kai quickly opened it, setting the panel aside. The larger, solitary cable on this side had melted, the metal and rubber on the bottom of the box. "Well, I think this might be the problem." I stated, very obviously. "You think?" Kai replied, voice flat. At that moment, Dale returned, with a bag that held wires and a small light. "Had to borrow this from Kai's collection, but it should work." Kai feigned anger. "How could you possibly steal from me, Dale, I thought you were better than this!" It was the most emotion I had seen him express since meeting him. "That should work, but I'll need someone who can cut and splice the wires." "I can." Kai responded, as we moved towards the first panel. "Cut this wire, and splice it to the light, please." Kai cut the main cable with one of the leaves on his hand, and deftly spliced the exposed output of the panel to the small light contraption, and it lit up. "Working. Can we mark it with something? Also, if you could unsplice them, please, Kai." Dale galloped off to the orchard as Kai untied the wires, his hands slightly scorched, but he took a drink out of a bottle he produced from the bag he wore. "Do you happen to have something that doesn't conduct electricity to bind the cable back to the main cable?" I asked. "I have tape." "That's good." Dale came back and set a bag of apples on the ground, and Kai took one and set it infront of the panel we had checked. "Ok, now we can splice the main wire back together and check the next one." We checked every panel, and only a couple of them couldn't turn on the light, and we circled back to them, skipping the first one, which was the one Kai had taken the cover off earlier, with its wire in need of solder. He deftly took off the back cover, and I started examining where the wires connected to the board, expecting another issue there. Kai hovered over my shoulder, looking at it as well. "...This cable is cut." He pointed to one, which was, infact, cut. "Good catch." We examined the rest of it, and found little issue outside of the cut wire. As we moved from panel to panel, we found small errors, a missing wire here, a melted one there, ones that could be put down as mistakes, but they felt... deliberate, to me. I couldn't pin down why, but the only error we'd found that felt like a genuine mistake was the melted cable in the powerbox. I voiced as such to the other two, and Kai muttered something under his breath as Dale stomped a hoof. "I don't know why they feel deliberate, they just do. We can probably fix them all, if we have solder and spare wire." Kai pulled out a small solder kit out of his bag as he walked over to the first one we had checked, kneeling down by it. "You know how to do electrical work?" I asked, since Dale had mentioned something about nobody else being able to work on the panels. "Yeah, but I'm not immune to electricity. If I had seriously tried to fix all of these, even if I knew which ones were broken, which I didn't, I probably wouldve died at the fourth or fifth just trying to find the issue, even with Alto's potion." His solder was splotchy, and he took out a small cloth and wiped off some of the extra. "And, these aren't vital enough for anybody to ask me to risk my life." Dale nodded at that. "Everyone's aware that he's good with electronics, but we also knew he wasn't good enough to find and fix everything without either a lot of medicine, which we can't supply, or dying, which nobody really wanted." He put the metal back back onto the panel, and rebolted it, taking the bolts from his bag. "We also don't have any spare wire around the village, other than the things I've already made, but again, we aren't dependent on the solar power." I had an idea upon hearing about their lack of wire, but I didn't entirely know why I thought it'd work. "...I know this'll sound weird, but pull out some of my fur and try using that as a wire." He looked at me, quizzically, and then turned to Dale. "I know Jolteon produce bioelectricity, but hasn't their fur been tried before?" Dale thought for a second, then replied. "I think I remember some Jolteon goin' to the Electrician's guild and tryin' it. I don't think it worked, but we were in-between assignments at the time it happened, so I didn't hear anythin'." "I have a hunch that it'll work. Besides, what's the worst that could happen?" Kai shrugged, and went to pull out some fur. As he touched my fur, he jumped back immediately, coughing and wheezing. "How-" He pulled out the bottle he drunk from earlier, and drained it. "How can you hold so much electricity?" His arm, which had been blackened, started to crack, showing healthy skin underneath. I looked at him, confused. "What do you mean?" "Don't you feel... I don't know, full of electricity?" He breathed heavily. "Arceus, I feel like I almost died." "I don't feel like I have any electricity, to be honest with you. I just assumed that was... normal?" Dale chuckled. "Usually, Jolteon can feel about how much electricity they have. You should check, if you can." On instinct, I raised my front left paw, revealing a small black screen that read 'Danger! Discharge ASAP!' "I have a screen on my leg. It's telling me I'm in danger." "Well, you can hit me with a lightning bolt or something, I can take it." Dale said, but I wasn't quite sure how to do so, honestly. "...How?" Kai looked at me flatly. "How can you not know how to... just use any move." The portion on moves had been quite slim, and boiled down to 'You'll know how to use them.' Dale noticed my confusion. "It's different for every type, so we can't give you exact instructions, but just follow your instincts, you should know how to use 'em, even if you have amnesia." I focused, and felt something in me shift, so I pounced on that sensation, and focused on moving whatever that was forward, towards Dale. It felt like a pressure, building in my head as I pushed. It built and built, until something popped, and the pressure released. A massive bolt of lightning arced out of me, crashing into Dale with such force that he staggered back. A deafening crack split the air. "Arceus, what <em>are</em> you?" Kai gasped, behind me. The bolt was gone in a moment, but I saw Alto light down next to Kai. "I heard a crack and saw a flash, what happened?" She asked, to which Kai responded. "Lance used lightning bolt." Dale, chuckling, added to that. "He had a massive bolt, Alto. Bigger than my entire body." He threw his head back and laughed. "I haven't been hit like that in a long time, even though it did nothin'." "Oh, also, I had to use the rest of that potion you gave me." "Why?" Alto turned to Kai. "What did you do?" He paled, a little, and replied. "I... touched his fur." She blew up at him. "You're an idiot! 'Oh yeah why don't I touch the electric type! I'm so smart!' You're aware how difficult that potion is to make!" "In his defence, it was my idea." I said, trying to get her off of him. "He thinks his fur can be used as a conductor." Kai added, and Alto laughed a little. "Yeah, why don't you touch the Jolteon who just unleashed a bolt strong enough to vaporize a large tree!" Dale trotted over to her and pushed her away from Kai, a little. "Alto, Alto. Lance thinks he has a hunch, and Kai n' I thought he'd be fine to pull off a bit of fur, since he's good with wires n' such." She calmed down, a bit, and turned to Dale. "Well, you should've been the one to do it, since you're a ground-type. He's only resistant, you're full-on immune." Dale blanched a little. "You... have a point, Alto." "We're lucky Kai didn't die. Be more careful." Dale turned back to me. "Lance, what's that little screen say?" I lifted my leg to look at it, but immediately fell over. "I... will check in a second. I feel a bit dizzy." My stomach growled. "And a bit hungry." Kai threw an apple from the bag over to me, and I caught it, still laying down, and bit into it. "In the meantime, why don't you pull out some of my fur, so we can try it." Alto interjected, as Dale started to trot over. "Oh no you don't, you're using a brush. I don't want Lance getting an infection because you accidentally pulled out some skin." She pulled out a brush from her cloud, and flapped up onto Dale's head, putting it in his mouth. "Ok, doc." He said, around the brush, and he leaned his head down and brushed me once as I lay there. A small amount of the coppery fur came away with the brush, and Kai came over and grabbed a couple strands. "Huh. It feels a lot like wire already." He twisted the strands together, and they retained their shape. He walked over to one of the panels which had a cut wire, and started working on it. "Wow. It... actually worked." He held up the light, and it was on. He walked over to Alto. "Do you have anymore of that healing potion?" Alto sighed, and rummaged around in her cloud, before pulling out another bottle, this one significantly more empty. "I would rather you not use it. I can go get Samuel to help." As if on cue, Samuel popped his head out of the ground next to her. "I heard a really loud crack, is everything OK?" Alto turned to him. "Lance used lightning bolt. Can you help Kai repair the solar panels?" Samuel looked over at me. "Huh. Loud lightning bolt." He turned over to Kai. "So what do you need me to do?" "Follow me." Kai grabbed the brush from Dale, and walked off to the next broken panel, and Samuel followed him. Alto hopped over to me, and held out a different bottle from the one she'd offered Kai. "Water. It'll help with the dizziness." I drunk from the bottle, leaving about half of it, and managed to stand back up, checking the screen on my leg. "Hm... it says I'm safe, at about... 7.45 percent? Out of what?" "That's probably out of your safe capacity, if I had to hazard a guess." Alto supplied, "Anyways, I have to go make more healing potions. Again. Just call for me if you need anything." She flew off, back towards the town, and I walked over to the power box, examining the melted wire. "So, this melted, right?" Dale asked. "Yeah. It's because if you have too much electricity running through one cable, it'll overheat and melt. You'd need to run multiple." Again, the words felt like my body was saying them without my mind's input. Dale groaned. "We don't have the wire for that, unless you donate a bunch of fur." I thought for a second, and something occured to me. "Well, I released a lot of energy when I shocked you, right? My fur didn't melt then, so you'd only need one cable in that case, maybe. You'd obviously need to find something that wouldn't melt to cover it in, but that shouldn't be too hard." Dale took a second to respond. "I can't think of anythin'. What would you recommend?" "Quartz. Very good insulator."  "We might have some in one of our stores, somewhere. Let's go check." We moved off towards the town.<br>
            <br>
            We arrived at the town, winding around some of the homes, ending at a squat building that Dale entered, with me right behind. "Well, this is one of our storehouses. All we have to do is find some quartz." Dale said. As I entered, Dale motioned to a couple boxes in a corner. "Over there are the boxes we put all of the minerals we find. Let's get searchin'." He moved over to the crates, opening one of them and tipping it over, spilling rocks all over the ground. I went over, and immediately jumped back as my leg brushed against one of the rocks. It burned, the pain overtaking my mind and blanking all thoughts out. I came back to on the ground, Dale and Alto over me, Alto smearing something on the leg that had burnt. "Hey, are you OK?" Dale had noticed me wake up. "You touched one of the rocks and jumped back. I went and got Alto, since you'd passed out." "I... ow... I don't know what happened." I replied, and Alto cut in. "You had a very... severe allergic reaction. That isn't normal, you know. Pokemon aren't usually allergic to a random rock." Something clicked in my mind. "I... think that one is quartz." Dale snorted. "You're allergic to the rock you wanted us to grab? That's pretty stupid of you." Alto wiped the gunk she'd smeared off of my leg, and helped me back up. "Just... don't touch anymore quartz. I don't want to have to save you from another anaphylactic shock." I nodded. "Sorry to interrupt you twice in one day." "Don't be, it's what I do." She hopped out of the storehouse, flying off. My leg itched, a little, but I ignored it. "Well, now I know what to target. Stand back." Dale huffed, focusing, and I moved to the other side of the room. He stomped the ground, and some of the rocks that had been scattered flew over, levitating in front of him, before he slackened a little, and the rocks fell to the ground. "There. All that's quartz." He used his hooves to push them aside, and beckoned to me. "Come help me get these back into the crate, please." I walked over and started helping him return the various crystals to the crate. "How did you do that, by the way?" I asked, a bit curious. "Somethin' you'll learn is that sometimes you've gotta get creative with how you use your moves. Stealth rock is great for trapping an area, but if you use it smartly, it can manipulate pretty much any smaller rocks however you like." I scooped some rocks into the box, when one caught my eye. "Do you know what that one is?" I pointed to it, scooping others back into the crate. "Well, if you want it, you can have it. I can't imagine we'll need many of these rocks." He scooped up some more rocks with stealth rock, dropping them en-masse into the crate. "I am a bit confused as to why you wouldn't recognize it, though. It's a thunder stone, which would be how you'd've evolved from an Eevee." I looked at him, blankly. "Amnesia, remember?" He chuckled. "I guess I forgot, with how adept you looked in the solar field." "I guess I was pretty comfortable, huh. To be honest, I've no clue what happened. I was following instinct. If you noticed, my paw would hover over an area, ready to do something." Dale laughed a bit. "Well, your instinct is sometimes the best tool you have. It's built from experience, so maybe you were part of the Electrician's guild, though, there wasn't a bandana near you at the beach, but there was a pair of odd filligree rings, which are in your house now, along with some other things." Huh. I resolved to examine whatever was with me, to try to get a clue as to who I was. "Well, let's go." He popped the quartz rocks into his bag, and trotted out of the building. I grabbed the thunder stone and followed. As we left, he turned to me and said, "Maybe you should take the rest of the day, I doubt that Kai and Samuel have fixed all of the panels, and even if they have, you just passed out from touchin' the quartz. Take the day and rest." I felt like I should be up and helping, but he was correct. "I feel like I should be doing things, though." "Lance, you passed out from a brush against a stone, and you have a rash on your leg from the same." I sighed. "Fine, I'll go home." He chuckled. "Don't work yourself too hard, you aren't under a time crunch, the panels will be fine until tommorow. Oh, also, take this." He reached his head inside, and pulled out a yellow cloth bag, setting it over my head. "It'll be useful, I can get someone to fit it to you later." "Thanks, Dale." I set the thunder stone inside the bag, and he set off towards the orchard, assumedly to set the quartz by the power box, leaving me alone. I started to walk towards my house, trying to remember anything that would explain why I was so comfortable with wires, or why I collapsed at the mere touch of quartz. I wasn't able to remember much, but nothing felt <em>wrong</em>, deep down. I entered my home, and set my new bag by the door. I searched around for the rings, and found them next to a slick white box with wires poking out of it. It was about half my height, and about half as long as me. These were obviously mine, as they'd been by me on the beach, but I had no clue what they were. I examined the white box, and found a button. I pressed it, and the top of the box slid open, revealing a pale blue screen of some sort. It had a couple icons on it, including a spear, a shield, and a purple gem. I pressed the gem, and blue lights came from the corners, focused on the space above the box. I backed away from it a bit, and they coalesced into a purple gem, which fell a short way and clattered atop the box. I took it and pressed the button again, which slid the top of the box closed again. It was small enough to fit into my bag, so I put it and the gem into it, and turned my attention over to the rings, which were the same color as my fur, with a smooth round gem the same shade as the one I'd gotten from the box. There were ingravings on the inside of them, but they were strange symbols I couldn't decypher. They felt... comforting, somehow. Not like the wires, but similar. I pulsed a small lightning bolt into one of the cirlces, but it didn't react. I tapped the gem on it, and something pulled at my mind, but nothing visibly happened. I moved my paw away, and moved them into my bag. I looked around for anything else, but I only found apples, bread, cheese, and milk on a table. I realized I felt famished, so I began to dig in to the food. After eating, I took the box back out of my bag. I opened the top again, and I started examining every symbol I could, all of them items, but none held any significance I could remember. When I tore myself away from the box, bereft of any clues, I noticed it was sunset, so I placed the box back into my bag, and trotted over to my bed, falling asleep fairly quickly.<br>

            Me and The Drifter arrived at the next town, a small place called Appleton, at about midday, a day or two after we left the ruins. The Drifter beelined towards a Dale, a Mudsdale, telling me about them and Alto, an Altaria, who was apparently the local doctor. Dale chuckled as we approached. "Hey, Drifters, welcome to Appleton, first time I've seen two of you, what do you need?" He asked. "What were you laughing at?" I asked, to which he responded, "Well, you're the second Eeveelution I've met who has somethin' odd with em. We have Lance, a Jolteon, who has coppery fur as well. You'll probably see him if you stick around long enough." Something in my gut urged me to drop everything and find this Jolteon, but I ignored it. "I wanted to buy a bag for my partner, here." The Drifter answered the earlier query, to which Dale led us over to a storehouse, and handed us a purple bag. "It fits with your color scheme, and it's free if you help us with setting up the wire." "What do you need us to do?" The Drifter and I asked, not quite in unison, as I manifested a pair of hands to put on the bag. The Drifter tossed me the amethyst seeds as Dale responded. "Well, Neither of you are a ground-type, but you should be able to help somehow, I'll leave that up to Kai and Lance, just follow me to the solar panels." He trotted over towards an orchard, with me and The Drifter following. As we approached the other side of the orchard, something in my mind felt... odd. I peered into the ambient media, and saw a potent mass of the stuff hovering around a Pokemon, obscuring them. I stopped looking at the mental energy, and the source of it was revealed to be a Jolteon who had fur that looked like the same orangeish metal, which I supposed was copper, that I had seen under the amethyst in my library. He was lying down on the ground, with a Silicobra brushing his fur down. "That's Lance n Samuel, Sam's currently brushin' Lance to get loose fur for the wires." The Drifter looked over at Dale, mild confusion on their face. "Didn't the Electrician's guild..?" They implied the rest of the question, and Dale chuckled. "We've got a real strange one, that's for sure." I hadn't entirely noticed, but I had been walking towards Lance. When I got up to him, I wasn't entirely sure what to say, since I hadn't planned to talk to him, I'd just walked over. Thankfully, He initiated conversation first. "You seem... familiar." He said, standing up. "What's your name?" Something in my gut was nervous, but I ignored the feeling and replied outright. "Seiko, Dale told me you were Lance?" The Drifter appeared at my side, smiling. "And I'm known as The Drifter, we were told you'd be the person to talk to about helping with setting up the wires." Lance paused, but then addressed us both. "Well, we just about have enough to start replacing the old cable, so if you two could go and spool it up, that would be great. It's the bigger one, over there." He gestured towards a power box with many wires, then turned to me. "I do want to talk to you later, Seiko. After we're done with this." I felt much the same way, Some memory in my library had reappeared when I talked to him, but it hadn't taken up my vision like the others had. He walked over to the Grovyle, who I assumed was Kai, and started talking with them. I turned to The Drifter, who had started walking towards the box Lance had gestured to, and I ran a little to catch up with them. When we reached the box, they grabbed the largest wire and pulled it out. It came out in a mess of melted metal and rubber, which they dropped immediately. "...The Electrician's guild has really been going downhill, huh." They stated. "They're supposed to account for this stuff, it's literally their job." They shook their head. "We should meet in the middle, it'll take less time." I said, picking the melted clump up with a telekinetic hand. "You go grab the other end." I manifested a second hand and started coiling the wire, as The Drifter ran off, following the wire.<br>
            <br>
            As my telekinetic hands wound the cable, I tried, as I had many times during the journey here with The Drifter, to interrogate that voice in my head. I hadn't been able to pinpoint where exactly it was in my library, but the surge of... recognition or emotion, I wasnt quite sure, that it had released when it heard Lance's name had given me where to look. I found what felt like a giant crystal, in a room in my library. When I pierced it, looking into its core, it felt like a library of its own, with layers upon layers of knowledge. I attempted to access one of the pieces of it at random, but it was indistinct and indescipherable. The ones that I could access held the information that I'd already learned from this voice, as well as a couple that I hadn't. I accessed one of them and saw... my mental image, infront of me. I noticed that my eyes had began looking into the psychic energy in the air, but I dissmissed that and focused back on myself. The projection was talking seemingly to me, but it held no spark of consciousness in it. <strong class="corpus">When using telekinetic abilities, you don't need to imitate your hands and arms, just focusing on the action being performed is enough.</strong> It cut off, not fully finished, but the rest of the information was unrecoverable. I accessed another, and it appeared before me again, saying. <strong class="corpus">When you learn to manipulate ambient media, which is an odd skill that somewhat requires [UNTRANSLATABLE], you can use this to do many things. I, personally, could only ever use it to-</strong> I then got the impression of moving wind with a fan, but there were no more words. I accessed a third, somewhat closer to the first one, and it contained information about imitating physical objects with telekinesis, and why it would be more useful at points. <strong class="corpus">Say you're trying to... let's go with wind a cable. You could use two telekinetic hands to do so, or you could just will the cable into being coiled, but both of those can be inefficient and costly. In this situation you might want to imitate a spool and wind the wire around that spool instead of using either of the other methods. Remember, telekinesis, [UNTRANSLATABLE], thrives when you find new and smarter ways to do the same thing.</strong> I was a little surprised that my exact current situation had been touched on, and I replaced the hands I had been using with a spool, winding the wire around it as I continued walking. I skimmed through many of the other pieces of knowledge, but many of them were incomplete and esoteric. I had no basis for many of them, so I ended up applying a small mental note with some keywords on each of them. I was still lost in thought when I collided with The Drifter, who was also lost in thought, looking up. They fell over, dropping their end of the wire, which kept coiling into my psychic spool. "Ah! Seiko! I didn't think we'd made that much progress with the wire!" They got up from the dirt, brushing themselves off. I sped up the spool's turning, coiling the wire faster. "I guess we did do it fairly quickly, huh." The wire finished spooling, and The Drifter went to take the bundle out of the air. When they grabbed it, I demanifested the spool, letting them take it. "Let's get back to the solar panels." They said, starting off in that direction, and I followed, still thinking about the strange corpus of knowledge in my head. Was that really... me? Did I make that?<br>
            <br>
            We got back, and Dale trotted up to us, taking the coiled wire. "We've got the new wire almost set up, just gotta get the insulation on there. I'll handle it when I get back from putin' this in the storehouse." He galloped off, and The Drifter walked over to a spot outside the solar panels proper and laid down, enjoying the sun. I walked over with them, and asked something that had been itching at my mind. "So... how does your shapeshifting... work? Do you entirely assume the new form?" It was a question that had slowly formed, after I found a page that contained the Zoroark from my memories explaining how their shapeshifting worked, describing it as an illusion. I'd no clue who they were explaining it <em>to</em>, but they were explaining it in earnest. The Drifter turned their head to me,  and answered back, quiet enough that only I could hear. "It's a bit of that, but it's also a bit of an illusion." They held a wing up in front of them. "It feels and acts as if it's my own body, and any damage dealt to me is reflected in a similar spot on my real body." They let their wing fall back to the ground. "But don't get the moves of the pokémon I transform into, so there's that." They sighed. "It's weird. On one paw, I can feel myself photosynthesizing at the moment, but on the other, I'm not actually gaining energy from it." I smacked them, lightly, on the forehead. "I am curious, where do you feel that pain?" They used a wing to smack at me, which I dodged, then replied. "I felt it on my forehead, dummy. I feel everything as if I'm the pokémon I look like." A mass of energy hit me from behind, making me feel like I had just been hit by a truck. "Also, you should look behind you more often. Helps you dodge." They laughed, then took a berry out of their bag and tossed it to me. "Eat this, it'll heal any non physical and smaller injuries you have. You've probably taken a bit from my shadow ball, given you're weak to ghost-type moves and all." I caught the berry with telekinesis, and started eating it when I had an idea. I could manipulate objects <em>directly</em> with telekinesis, no? Would that work on someone else? I lifted The Drifter into the air with telekinesis, slowly at first, as I was struggling, but I managed to pick up the pace as they noticed and squawked in surprise. "Hey- put me down!" I lifted them a bit higher in the air as I finished the berry, then spoke. "Well, maybe you should dodge the telekinesis next time. Simple as." I carried them over to the panels, as Dale returned from putting the old cable into storage. The Drifter called out to him from midair. "DALE! HELP! IM BEING LIFTED AGAINST MY WILL!" Dale saw what I was doing, and chuckled. "You're a bird, ain't you supposed to fly?" He called back, a bit of mirth in his voice. The Drifter was twisting about midair, trying to break free of the telekinesis, and I considered dropping them from midair, but that might've done too much damage, so I gently lowered them to about a foot off the ground, and dropped them in a heap. I leaned over to Dale and spoke. "They couldn't dodge the telekinesis." He chucked a bit more, replying, "Well, that's on them, ain't it?" The Drifter got up and dusted themselves off, before sending another shadow ball towards me, this one looking fairly weak. As it approached, I remembered what the... vision of myself I'd seen had mentioned about telekinesis affecting more than just physical matter, and had another idea. I manifested a solid square of media, and hit the shadow ball with it, aiming for The Drifter. Somehow, the shadow ball smacked against my makeshift paddle and went careening back to sender. They looked astonished for a second, before they jumped to the side, barely dodging it. "How'd you manage that?" They called, a bit of shock still on their face. Dale chuckled, as the realization of what I'd done set in on me. I could just... bat moves aside. With my mind. The Drifter reached us, and nudged me with their foot. "No, seriously, how did you do that? I didn't see you set up Mirror Coat, so what did you even do?" I took a second, unsure of how to explain it. "I... used telekinesis? It's hard to understand if you aren't a psychic type." Dale was laughing, now. "I haven't seen somethin' like that since..." His laughter died. "In a long time." He shook his head. "Anywho, I should get started on the insulation." He moved towards the power box, where Kai was holding a long copper cable, which looked like it had been woven of a million smaller wires. Lance was laid down on the grass next to it, with Samuel stretched out next to him. Lance's fur looked... immaculate. The way it glittered in the sunlight, combined with it being so well-groomed, made him look really... handsome? Where had that come from? I shook the thought away as Dale stomped a hoof, causing some rocks that had been in a bag next to the power box to levitate. "Hey, Seiko, can you use yer telekinesis to lift the cable up 'n stretch it out?" Dale said, his concentration focused on whatever he was doing with the rocks. "Sure." I said, as I grabbed the cable from Kai and unspooled it partially in the air. Dale moved the rocks towards the cable, and stomped his hoof again, breaking them into smaller crystals. As they touched the cable, they felt... moldable, in my mind. Some aspect of my telekinesis, or whatever it was at this point, flowed smoothly through the crystalline structure of what I now realized was quartz. I let my power seep into the stones, feeling a secondary presence controlling them, which I assumed to be Dale. My eyes had closed, but I heard Dale exclaim in surprise, and the presence from the rocks I was now controlling vanished. I moved the crystals closer into the cable, feeling them meld into one single crystal casing. <strong class="corpus">My [UNTRANSLATABLE] allows me...</strong> It was patchy, and incomplete, but I heard the corpus reveal another piece of knowledge to me. <strong class="corpus">...grow.</strong> The quartz slowly but surely started growing across the cable, covering it slowly but surely. I heard shouts of astonishment, but my concentration remained on these crystals, forcing them to grow, to expand, to flex into a suitable cable insulation. I felt the familiar sensation of a memory bubbling to the surface of my mind, now revealed in my library, but I had only a single purpose in mind, now. I had to complete this cable.<br>
            <br>
            ==<br>
            <br>
            Seiko was floating, about a foot off the ground, and their fur had started shining, no longer its usual pink, but an amethyst magenta. Me and Dale backed away, Dale letting the quartz he was working with go, and watching it get pulled into the growing mass of it that was encasing the cable. It was being unspooled from one side and respooled, with a new quartz exterior, on the other. "Do... do you know what's happenin'?" Dale asked me, but I was clueless. "I... no? I don't think I've ever seen an Espeon do anything like this before..." Lance, who had been lying down, was stood up, staring intently at what was happening. He was enraptured by the sight. "It seems like he's usin' a rock-type move, but not one I've seen." Dale shook his head, then called to Lance. "Hey, Lance! You're allergic to quartz, remember?" Lance had been slowly edging towards the cable, looking like he was in a trance. "He can't hear you." I said, as I rushed towards the Jolteon to get him away from the rocks littering the ground. It felt a bit odd, but I'd met pokémon who had odd conditions before, even if none of them were allergic to a crystal. "Don't-" Dale called after me as I reached Lance, attempting to grab him. When I touched him, everything seized up, I felt like I had eaten a bunch of Chesto berries, and could stay awake for the next year. My mind had blanked out, and I came back to with Alto looking down, she had erected a small cloud cover around us. "You're lucky I was so close. I don't think you'd want this out in the open." She was tending to some wounds I had, and I realized I had reverted back into my Hisuian Zorua form. "You'll be added to the list of geniuses who decided to touch the electric dog." She chuckled, forcing a potion down my throat. I drank it, then responded. "...Kai? Also, thank you for preserving my anonymity." She chuckled. "Yes, and you're welcome. I take Doctor-Patient privilege very seriously." Dale crashed through the cloud cover, before noticing that I was not, in fact, a Decidueye. He chuckled to himself. "Guess that disproves the guild theory, I felt it was a little odd that every drifter that came by remembered who everyone was in the town." "I- you- you aren't going to kill me?" He laughed, and responded, tone light. "If I didn't trust any ghost types, I'd've died in a dungeon long ago. Besides, you've done a bunch for the community. Hardly gonna hunt down someone who's done so much good." Alto turned to him, a bit incensed, and half-yelled. "You made me break my confidentiality with my client here, do you mind explaining yourself?" She was still tending to miscellaneous wounds while she spoke. "Oh, that reminds me why I barged in here, Seiko collapsed after he made the cable, and I assume you'd want to take a look at him." Alto sighed, and turned to me. "I've got you in a state where you can transform back, just don't go touching any more balls of electricity." I took my form and molded it, almost like clay, until it fit the form and appearance of a Decidueye, after which, Alto dismissed the cloud cover and turned, looking for Seiko. I got up off of the ground, dusting myself off while I did, and searched for him myself. We found him collapsed in a heap, his forehead gem and arm black. "...I really wish Xander would get here soon, They're the one who deals with psychic-type damages the most." Almost on cue, a Natu appeared next to her in a poof of pink smoke. "I finally got off guild work, Alto. You said you had an amnesiac for me to sink my claws into?" I staggered back a little, before I remembered both that I was wearing the form of a Decidueye, and that Natu learned teleportation fairly easily. Alto turned to him, and responded, voice only a little tired. "Yes, he's the orange Jolteon, his name is Lance and he doesn't remember much else." I chimed in. "Also, Seiko, the Espeon infront of us, is an amnesiac as well." Xander looked at Seiko's unconscious form, and was a little surprised. "Huh. Not every day you see a psychic type with amnesia, also, what's up with the paw? Why's it black?" He pecked at the leg in question. "And why does it feel like a rock?" "According to him, it's made of amethyst. Apparently it's normal?" I hadn't gotten too much out of Seiko, so what I shared was pretty much it. "Well, his gem is dark, that means he needs to lie down in the sun for a hot second while he recharges. While he does that, I'm going to go interrogate Lance. Make sure he doesn't run off, I'd really like to know what happened to give a psychic type amnesia." He flew off, searching for Lance. I picked up the unconscious Seiko, and carried him over to the field where he had picked me up earlier, depositing him on the grass, gem pointed towards the sun. I felt the same pull on my mind as I had when he was starved, so I pulled an amethyst out of my bag and set it next to him. It vanished in an instant, leaving behind a small portion of it. The gem on his forehead seemed to light, just a little, so I grabbed the rest of the amethysts I had and set them on him. They shrunk, just a little, but then began growing, covering him in a shell of amethyst. I saw a faint purple light in the center of the amethyst, and assumed that meant everything was OK, so I laid down on the grass next to him, and before I knew it, I had dozed off.<br>
            <br>
            ==<br>
            <br>
            Dale had dragged me to the other side of the field, snapping me out of whatever state I was in before I got too close to whatever Seiko was doing with the quartz. Seeing him had felt familiar, and it felt like I <em>should</em> be remembering something, but I wasn't. I was trying to chase down that sensation, in a similar manner to using a move, when a small green bird landed next to me and introduced himself. "Hello! I'm Xander, presumably Alto mentioned me?" "Uh... no, unless you're the 'specialist' she was talking about for my amnesia." The small bird chirped, in a way that sounded like laughter. "Yes, I'm a licensed Neurologist with the Medic's Guild, do I have your consent to look around in your head and maybe see if I can't figure out the amnesia?" I nodded "Yeah, you do. I'd personally really like to know what happened myself so..." Instantly, I was somewhere else. My new surroundings were... familiar. I was in a smaller room, with wires and bits of electronics piled around me. I looked around, a little confused. I reached out to one of the piles of electronic parts and realized that I was no longer a Jolteon, but a bipedal creature, with pale skin. Xander spoke up from somewhere near me. "Huh. You have a defined mental space. It reminds me of one of the spare parts rooms in the Electrician's guild." I looked around for him, and saw him atop one of the piles, looking in a different direction. "You've probably interacted with a psychic-type before... That's really the only way to have a defined mental world like this." He hopped, turning around, and nearly dropped off of his perch when he saw me. "Holy-" I caught him with one hand. "You have a self-image that is completely incongruous with your physical appearance, usually I'd say it's because you're dysphoric, but this is on another level." He righted himself, still on my hand. "I've never seen something like you before, honestly." "I... have no clue what I am either." I lifted him up to my head, and he hopped onto it. "Well, this likely means you've undergone some serious stuff, the fact you have this mental world tells me you've interacted with a psychic type, and a strong one at that. Do you have any clue where your memories would be, in this analogy?" I looked around, and saw a small sign above a door I hadn't noticed that read 'Hard Drive Storage'. "I... think that's it?" He flew over to the door. "You should stay here, trying to access your memories might break you if you have aggressively induced amnesia." He flew through the door, and immediately flew back out of it. "..." I found myself back in my body, looking at him, and he opened his eyes. "I... you... what..." He was thinking, it was visible in his eyes, trying to find a way to vocalize what he saw. "There's... no good way to tell you this, but I didn't see anything." He said, finally. "I... wouldn't that be the case?" I asked. "I do have amnesia, after all." He held up a wing. "No, no, no. You don't have <em>anything</em>. Usually, if you had amnesia due to a traumatic brain injury or the like, there'd be visible damage, if you instead had your memories eaten, like by a Musharna, it'd be patchy. But you don't have anything there. It's as if the memories never existed in the first place. They obviously have, since you know language and have a sense of self, but the memories aren't there to inform either." He shook himself side to side. "You're a really interesting case, that's for sure." He hopped into the air, taking off. "I'm going to go take a look at Seiko, and see if his amnesia lines up with yours. You should go home and rest until then." He flew off, leaving me to consider what he said. What did he mean by nothing? How could I not have any memories at all?<br>
            <br>
            ==<br>
            <br>
            grow. consume. grow. consume.<br>
            <br>
            The mantra continued in a steady pattern. I opened my eyes, I was in my library. Everything was pulsing, as if the entire space was breathing. grow. consume. grow. consume. I felt more sated with every pulse, as if I had starved myself again. I rushed over to where my most recent memories were stored, and opened the most recent book. I was bowled over by the force of the memory, so I closed it and found my way to the reading room, sitting in the chair before I tried reading it again. Growing. That was everything. I had to cultivate the crystal. I had to shape it into a useful form. I was the farmer, and it was my crop. It must be perfect. I slammed the book closed, and regained my senses. I vaguely remembered some books revealing themselves to me, so I willed the book back onto its shelf. It disappeared from my hand, and I felt it appear back in its rightful place. I stood up and wandered my way towards the empty fields, before I felt a pushing sensation, someone trying to get in. I kept the door shut, but they were hammering on it, trying to force their way in. Eventually, my mind gave way, and a small Natu appeared in front of me, breathing heavily. "You... have some good defenses, huh." I stepped back from the bird, and spoke. "Who are you, and what are you doing in my library?" The Natu looked up, momentarily shocked upon seeing me, but responded. "I'm Xander, a Neurologist. Alto had me come to take a look at Lance, and that Decidueye mentioned you also had amnesia. I entered your mind because I was very curious as to what could cause a psychic-type to loose their memories." I swept my left arm towards the empty expanse, lacking bookshelves. "Well, as you can see, my collection is a bit light. The books are just gone." Xander hopped up onto my head, and replied. "Well, it was the same for Lance, including the strange self-image." I paused at that. "What do you mean, strange self-image? Actually, don't answer that yet, let me collect the new books and we can talk in my reading room." He hopped off of my head, and took off. "I'm going to see if I can't get any more information about your odd situation. Just... will my mental projection over there when you need me, I guess." He flapped off, disappearing over a bookcase. I wandered, grabbing the books that had appeared, all in different places, and set off towards the reading room once again. I arrived, setting the books down on the desk, and started thinking of how to move Xander's mental projection to the room. I could feel his avatar in my mind, a foriegn object, and I tried just thinking about it being in the room. That didn't work, but it gave me an idea. I mentally moved the room around his avatar, then moved the room back, which gave the desired effect. He appeared ontop of the reading desk, fluttering a bit, with a key almost as large as him in his talons. I felt a small page appear in my mind, but I was more interested in what he had found. "AAA- Oh. Right." He took a second, calming down. "Still a bit shocked at how much control you have over this place. I wouldn't have pegged you as that strong of a psychic-type, given you got amnesia and all." A projection of me appeared, in the room. <strong class="corpus">I am in control of my own mind, not fully, but enough to where it lets me do wonderous things, like-</strong> The corpus cut off. "What was that?" Xander asked, "Why did another mental construct of you appear?" I sighed, and pulled the corpus into the room. It was a shockingly small gem, layered with many different pieces, all containing fragments of knowledge. "It came from this... thing. It has a bunch of stuff like that, but I've no clue <em>what</em> it is." Xander settled his feathers. "This is very much outside of my wheelhouse. I'm going to go grab an associate of mine who specializes in psychic-type pokemon. I'll be back in maybe ten seconds of real time." He dissapeared from my mind, and left me with no explanation of the key. I decided to kill time by wandering into the blank section, searching for the page the key had spawned. I found it, lying somewhat near where the books about the Espeon and the one that I'd gotten while I was growing the insulation, and returned to the reading room. Something told me about seven seconds had passed, despite it feeling like I'd taken a couple minutes just going there and back. It felt... right, though. The corpus not entirely giving me knowledge, but it resonated with some part of it. I was moving at the speed of thought, so it would make sense that, even if I was trying to kill time, it would take vastly longer in here then it would out there. Curious, I attempted to leave my library, but my strength failed me. I decided to check the memory I had unlocked with Lance in the meanwhile. I saw myself, bow in hand, shooting arrows at a pale, muscular... human? The word, recently associated, felt... inaccurate, but also felt like it was as close as I'd get. I was shooting arrows at him, the copper cable bowstring scraping against my right arm each time I loosed an arrow. The arrows materialized on the bow, made entirely of amethyst. I examined the bow, not in my memory, but outside of it, pausing and pouring over it. It was made of amethyst, and I could see a copper filligree frame inside of it. It was strung with a thick copper wire, and it felt, in the memory, comfortable and familiar in my hands. My opponent, who I realized had coppery hair, the same shade as Lance's fur, threw a copper- no, a copper-silver alloy javelin at me, and I knocked it away with my bow, before landing an arrow in his gut. He dashed at me, sparks flying off behind him, and hit me with the buckler he had on his left arm, pulsing electricity into me. The memory cut off there, with a vague sense of unreality. I went through it again, examining the thoughts and feelings behind the memory, and I got the sense I was pushing to improve, and that I should've ditched the bow after deflecting his projectile, and swapped to- the memory cut off before that thought finished, and I closed the book, setting it down on the desk. It had materialized after I had met Lance, so I had to assume the person I was fighting was Lance, but... it didn't feel agressive, at no point did I feel like my life was in danger. As I was thinking through that, an Espeon popped into my reading room, without any of the pressure or sensations of intrusion that I had felt with Xander. "He went on and on about there being significant mental defences, but here I am, without any to speak of." She- I didn't know how I knew, I just did, looked around, confused. "This feels... familiar." Xander, after a bit of pressure on my mind, popped in, and she turned to him. "Xander, you made such a fuss about mental defences, but I was able to get in just fine." Xander squaked in outrage. "Well, Sophia, it felt like I had to bust down a door just to get in here!" The name felt familiar, but in a different way then Lance's had. Sophia turned to me, and something flashed across her face. "...Seiko?" I hadn't given her my name, and judging by Xander's reaction, neither had he. "I didn't mention his name, are you having one of your precognitive episodes?" She shook her head. "No, I just... know him. You know how I told you I'd come from a far-off land? Seiko is from there too, I think." I was surprised at that, and interrupted. "I... what? What can you tell me? What do you remember about me?" Assumedly, she had more information about me than I did. "I... don't remember much about you, but I do remember that we were friends, and that you were there when I evolved." I rifled through the books, tossing the one that had an Espeon in it to her, which she caught with telekinesis. "Read that." She skimmed through the book. "It's a bit disorienting but... I think I recall... this moment. Something had happened with you, and I... can't remember much else." Xander looked at her flatly, despite the fact he was a tiny bird. "You... have had amnesia this entire time and only now decided to let your friend, who is a <em>neurologist</em>, know?" She turned to him. "I assumed the memories would come back! I'm a psychic-type!" Xander displayed so much annoyance with just his eyes and beak. "...I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you're an idiot." She laughed, realizing the absurdity of what she'd done. "I guess I am, huh." She walked over to the chair I was on and hopped into my lap, unsure of what to do, I began petting her. "Well, this is a pickle. One of the few things I do remember about you is that you had an eidetic memory." I interjected. "Meaning I can't forget anything, right? Also, Xander, what's with the key you found?" She nodded, as Xander hopped onto the table and responded. "Well, it's a mental construct, so it's associated with something that a key would do." I hadn't payed it much attention, so I picked it up and began to examine it. It was an ornate copper key, with three triangular teeth running the length of the blade. The handle was a large copper hexagon, with amethyst grown onto it in spikes. If I held it by the hexagon, as was likely intended, one of the spikes would inevitably break skin and cause me to bleed. I set it back down on the desk and perused the page that had manifested when I heard about it. "Hm. Looks like the only notes I can remember about it is that it 'unlocks the mind', whatever that means." Sophia looked up at the page. "I remember you using that a lot around when the other memory takes place. I assume it had something to do with the arm? It did appear around that time, too." "That explains the sense of confusion I had looking at it. I'm going to peruse the other memories I've unlocked, see if any of them touch on the key." Sophia was curled in my lap, and it felt comforting. I know it was just a mental image of the both of us, but it did feel like I was... myself, if that makes sense. I grabbed the book I hadn't read yet, and I opened it. I was looking at the copper filigree that would eventually become my staff. My husband had done wonderfully with it. I took one of the amethyst seeds out of a box on the workbench next to me, and implanted it into the base of the staff. I then focused myself into the gem, letting... something, I couldn't remember what, and the book didn't give me any answers, guide me. I pushed myself into the gem, saturating it fully, and then commanded it to <em>grow.</em> It expanded, covering the staff, and I cut it off before it fully covered the top. I grabbed a filigree sphere from the table next to me, and implanted a seed. This one was different, but again, the memory held no answers for me. I forced that gem to grow, until it made a rough ball over the filigree. It glowed with an inner light, one that felt like it held power in it. I realized, halfway through the memory, that my right arm was flesh and blood, and not the amethyst it was currently. This must've taken place before whatever happened to it. I resumed experiencing the memory, as I placed the crystaline orb atop the staff, in a small cradle left in the filigree, and grew the shaft to grasp the orb with multiple tendrils of amethyst. The staff complete, I started to wave it in the air, channeling my mind through it- The memory cut off there. "I made a staff." I said, and Sophia interjected, "Yeah, you've had one in every memory I've had of you, the crystal one, right?" "Yes, but I ended up using it... somehow. I don't know what I used it for, the memory cut off." Xander hopped around, thinking. "That interesting, but you've been unconscious in the real world for a couple hours, recharging in the sun, so if you could wake up, that would be great. I don't want to deal with a psychic-type in a coma, again." Sophia cringed at that. "Look it was one time-" "YOU KICKED ME OUT OF YOUR HEAD LIKE FIVE TIMES WHEN I WAS TRYING TO WAKE YOU UP!" She cringed more, and replied, meekly. "I... am sorry about that." She hopped off of my lap, looking up at me. "You really should wake up, though. Comas aren't fun when you're moving at the speed of thought." I scratched my head. "I was really only... not conscious, that isn't the right word... aware? I was really only aware of things a bit before Xander pushed in for the first time. Besides, when I tried to exit my library earlier, I felt... weak." Xander hopped in place, and Sophia was thinking, before she spoke. "Hm... I could try to help you?" Xander shot that down. "No, you can't really help someone wake up, they have to do it on their own power." My right hand went towards the key. "Well, since I can't wake up, I'm going to try to use this key, see what that does." I grabbed it with my amethyst hand, and it pierced the crystal flesh, causing me to yelp in surprise. I almost dropped the key, but my grip held, despite the pain it was causing. The pain dulled, and I felt my focus hone in on it, centering itself in my hand. Slowly, my mind leaked into the key, and I pushed it forward, the blade dissapearing into... somewhere. "Odd..." Xander said, looking at it. I turned the key midair, and suddenly, I was somewhere dark. Purple light filtered in, but I couldn't see where it was coming from. I felt my senses expand, and I felt a coiled mass of quartz a bit away from where I was, a collection of various gems nearby me, and a shell of amethyst around me. I could feel the rocks and metals underneath me, it was so many. It was so much input, so many different points of data, it was overwhelming. I heard voices, but they blended together, indistinct, and I collapsed back into my library, the key clattering to the ground next to me.<br>
            <br>
            ==<br>
<br>
            After we got forced out, Xander teleported somewhere, leaving me alone with Seiko and his friend. He was trapped in the crystal, and I'd felt a wave of energy from him. My memories were murky, but I knew he was a good friend of mine, so I laid down next to his shell and waited. The Decidueye that had been sleeping on the other side stood up, looking over. "Huh. Who're you?" They asked, towards me. "Don't tell me you're <em>another</em> strange, amnesiac Espeon who just appeared in my path while I was wandering, I already have the one." Their tone was light, almost playful, as they walked over to the other side of the crystal and sat down next to me. "I..." I wasn't sure exactly what to say, since I wasn't entirely feeling like banter at the moment. "I'm Sophia, I'm an old friend of Seiko's." They chuckled. "Really?" "Yes, really. I knew him before... this." I gestured around me with my tail. The Decidueye chuckled, then extended a wing to me. "I'm The Drifter, pleasure to meet you. Anything you can tell me about Seiko?" I laughed, nervously. "Well, I don't entirely remember much about him." They laughed, then responded. "So you <em>are</em> another odd amnesiac Espeon! Don't worry, I have experience." I was... a bit annoyed, to be honest, but they felt like they were actually wanting to help. At that moment, Alto and Xander flew back, and they landed next to us. "So, I do think he's undergoing sensory overload. Do you have anything to help with that?" Xander said as he landed, to which Alto responded. "No, I can't-" She cut off, and I collapsed. My head was filled with screaming, whirling noise, it was filling my every thought. My mind hardened, and a translucent wall appeared infront of me. I had instinctively used Protect. The Drifter was still sitting, but they had grabbed their head with their wings. The noise, no longer overwhelming me, stopped, and Xander and Alto got back up. Xander muttered under his breath, assumedly using Wish again, and Alto looked at the crystal containing Seiko. "What was that move?" The Drifter was leafing through a book, and called out. "Psychic Noise, I believe." Xander glared at The Drifter. "Why didn't you get knocked down like we did?" "Ghost." They hadn't looked up. "...Wish failed." "Of course it did, Psychic Noise blocks most healing moves from working." The Drifter put away the book, then looked over. "I feel like you all should try to stop him from using it <em>again</em>, I have Oran berries for your injuries." I closed my eyes and pushed into Seiko's mind, entering it surprisingly easily. It was chaotic, lights dancing, sounds blaring. I could smell a thousand different smells, and it was overloading my brain. I stopped, closing my eyes, and breathed, sorting the stimuli into categories, and blocking them out one by one. It took me a second, but I was able to open my eyes and not collapse into a heap. I searched the library, looking for Seiko, but I wasn't able to find him anywhere. I wandered through the stacks, glowing in a shifting kalidescope of colors, until I found myself at the small room he had used to read his memories. His mental image had changed shape to that of an Espeon, and he was curled on the floor, paws over his eyes. I walked over to him and laid down next to him. I didn't touch him or talk, since that might've made it worse, so I used Helping Hand, gaving him as much support as I could without adding more stimuli. "It's... so much..." He whimpered, his paws pressing more into his eyes. "Sophia... help... please..." He had sensed me enter his mind, of course he had. I stood up and tried taking control of the room we were in, trying to subvert his mind's natural defences and overriding his dominion over it. His mind felt much weaker, as it caved easily to my attack, and I shut the reading room from the rest of his mind, compartmentalizing it. He slowly stopped shaking, taking his paws off of his eyes and looking around. When he spoke, his voice was wavering, weak. "It... what... it's so... quiet." I turned to him, and looked him directly in the eyes. "Breathe." I said, "You're undergoing sensory overload. I'm going to slowly introduce input to you, and I need you to sort it and slowly incorporate it." He breathed, regaining his composure, and looked at me, thankful. "I... thank you. I need a second before you do that, though." He was shaky, still, but he was rapidly getting better. "I can wait, as long as you don't try to retake this room from me." My crystal was growing, but I was pulling from the energy in his mind to fuel my control. I wasn't... entirely sure <em>how</em> I was doing it, but I was. "I... won't." His form bubbled, and he transformed back into his human form, bones cracking grotesquely and skin stretching as he did. He sat back down in the armchair and closed his eyes, breathing heavily. After a while, he opened his eyes and looked at me, speaking. "I... think I'm ready. Hit me." "Heard." I responded, leveraging my control over this corner of his mind to pass his sense of sight onto him. The room erupted in radiant light, shifting color rapidly. A million different patterns of refracted right were on the walls, but it slowly dimmed as he regained control and comprehension over his sight. "Next one." He said, voice mildly shaky, and I released his sense of hearing. The room erupted in echoing rustles of paper, footsteps, and speech, a cacophany of noise, but he persisted, and it slowly silenced, one by one, as he reaserrted himself over his hearing. "Smell and Taste, now." I released the twin sensations onto him, and the room smelled like a million different things, their stenches overpowering, worming their way into my nose and mouth. I tasted lemon, sugar, and blood all at once. The coppery tang sticking on my tongue, slowly dissipating as he understood and reintegrated his mouth and nose. He took a second, his breathing quick, and calmed himself, readying for the next sense. I released his sense of touch, and felt myself get pulled in a million different directions, feeling every strand of fur on my body as they brushed against each other. I slowly lost feeling across my body, not completely, but enough to feel normal, as he ignored and blocked out the sensations of everything touching him. "That's all five, right?" He asked, but he knew the answer. "No, you have maybe two or three more left." I looked over the remaining senses, and one of them was familiar to me. "Here's your psychic sense." I unleashed it onto him, and I heard a million different voices invade my head, all of my thoughts opressive and loud, my emotions attempting to run wild, as well as others' thoughts and emotions. I felt a whirlwind of sadness, worry, compassion, and many others as Seiko relearned to block out the minds and thoughts of others. My mind felt, after he completed, clear, quiet. He paused for a second, assumedly sorting the thoughts he'd accumulated, before he spoke. "I... thank you, for..." I didn't have to hear the rest of it, I knew what he was talking about. "I trust you with my life, Seiko. You knew that, once. I'd probably follow you into some impossible battle, because I trust that you'd get us out of it." He was silent, but I got the impression from the way he was looking at me that he wanted to weather the next storm. I unlocked a sense alien to me, and I felt... connected, to all of the amethyst around me. No, not just the amethyst, connected to every crystal around me, covered in dirt, polished, it didn't matter. I was spread across a thousand- The sensation cut off, and Seiko was breathing heavily. "That's... a new one." I felt a memory surface in my mind, unlocked by that. It was that of Seiko holding his hand out over the ground, and a chunk of raw electrum flying out of the earth into it. It was short, but... "I guess that sense is how you knew where to find metal, when you needed it." I said, but before I could explain the memory, he responded. "Yeah. I wonder what I needed electrum for?" He had unlocked the same memory, from his perspective. "Well, there's one more. This one might knock you flat." He steadied himself, gripping the arms of his chair. "Hit me." I unleashed the final sense, and it savagely attacked him, trying to tear apart his self-image. I realized I hadn't been affected, and understood at once what this sense must've been.<br>
            <br>
            ==<br>
            <br>
            Who am I? It's a question everyone asks themselves at least once. I felt myself... tearing apart. I wasn't Seiko, I was an amnesiac who believed he was Seiko. I wasn't truly a human, I just found the memories and assumed they were mine, who wasn't to say I stole them? The self-doubt in my own identity was ripping me apart. I felt a presence on my lap, and heard Sophia speak, voice comforting. "You... are still the creative, inquisitive person I knew. You wouldn't be agonizing over every detail of your memories if you weren't. You see a mystery, an interesting problem, and you can't wait to solve it, because that's who you are. You're still the same gentle soul I knew, else you would have hollowed out the minds of those around you. You're still Seiko, maybe without memories, but the core of who you are is intact." Sophia had her front paws on my face, and was speaking into it, her face inches from mine, gem glowing. "Don't give up in yourself, what would your husband think?" I couldn't remember anything other than the fact I had a husband, and it seemed she remembered the same, but she had a point. I couldn't give up on myself just because I had lost my memories, she sure hadn't given up on me. I closed my eyes, steeling myself, and dismissed the questions of my identity. I was Seiko, mysterious stranger with an arm made of amethyst. I opened my eyes, resolved to uncover every last memory of myself that I could. The maelstrom of sounds and colors, of tastes and smells, had disappeared, leaving me no worse for wear than when I'd been swept up in the storm. Only the light of Sophia's gem, like a lantern in the dark, had guided me back to shore. I stood up, Sophia hopping off of my lap, and picked up the key. The spines dug into my hand, but no blood was drawn. "Well, like they say, second time's the charm, eh?" I said, pushing it into the air, and pausing for a second. "...Thank you, again." I said, looking at Sophia, before I turned the key and woke up, again, in a shell of amethyst. I consumed it, feeling it nourish and sate me, and emerged from the cocoon. The Drifter, Sophia, Xander, and Alto were around me, Sophia opening her eyes, Xander and Alto eating blue berries, and The Drifter scratching away at their journal. The Drifter looked up as the crystal dissapeared, and sighed, putting the book away. Alto immediately got in my face upon seeing I was awake, and started fussing over my condition. "Do you feel pain anywhere? Are you feeling dizzy, sick, tired, wrong?" She was hopping around me, searching my body for any injuries. "I feel fine, Alto, thank you, though." I said, trying to swat her away with my tail. She dodged and kept looking for any injuries. "He just went through a sensory overload episode, Alto, don't pelt him with questions as soon as he's awake." Sophia said, walking over. "Also, Xander, you can go back to Market Town, I'd rather stay here for the night." Xander fluffed his feathers, and tried to protest. "Sophia, I just found out you have amnesia, I'd be a terrible medic if I let you stay in an unfamiliar place-" She cut him off, and replied, "I have someone I know and trust right here, I'll be fine." She used her tail to gesture at me, and I felt slightly happier at that. "She did just help me sort through all of my senses, and pulled me back before I had a mental breakdown. I'd protect her with my life at this point, to be completely honest." He sighed, and conceded the point. "I would feel safer if you were in Market Town, but... I understand. You want to spend time alone with him." We both took a second, then realized what he'd meant. "I/He have/has a husband!" We said in unison, before I continued. "Not that I remember him, but still." He chuckled, "There goes my chances of being a wingman, alas, I am doomed to never see love blossom." Sophia chuckled. "Go find someone yourself, Xander." "I would, but I don't want to." He said, disappearing in a puff of pink smoke. Dale galloped over, and checked in on us. "Hey, yall doin' good? I saw yall collapse and rushed over here, what happened?" The Drifter explained, "Seiko used Psychic Noise, and was undergoing sensory overload, but he's fine now." Dale looked at me, concern in his eyes, "You doin' good? Need a place to stay for the night?" He chuckled. "You'd all be sharin' a house with Lance, since we only have the one, but I feel like yall would need someplace to stay for the night. It's been a long day, after all." I cleared my throat. "I'm doing... good, as far as that means for me, thank you, and I wouldn't mind sharing a house with Lance, I got a memory that shows us..." The word escaped me, and as I searched for it, Dale chuckled. "Doin' what?" Sophia used telekinesis to chuck a rock at him, and he caught it in his teeth. "Don't start with that, Xander just tried it." Dale dropped the rock, chuckling. "Don' worry, I won't make any assumptions." "Sparring. That's the word for what we were doing, I think. We were fighting, but it wasn't agressive." "Yeah, that'd be training for you. I used to do it with my team all the time, before..." He trailed off, lost in a memory. "Nothin', You all should get back to the town, Lance has already started headin' that way." He shook his head and galloped off towards the town, calling over his shoulder, "We're gonna put up the cable tommorow, by the way." Alto, satisfied that I wouldn't keel over and die, also took off towards the town, flying over the orchard. "Well, we have a place to spend the night, we should take advantage of that." The Drifter said, standing up. "Cmon, let's go." They walked towards the grove, and I started to follow, before Sophia caught my attention. "Hey, Seiko?" She asked, and I turned around to look at her. "Yeah?" She was gesturing at something on the ground with her tail. "Isn't that your mental key?" I looked at it closer, and she was right. It was the same key I'd used to exit my library. Why it was outside of my mind, I had no clue, but I used telekinesis to grab it, feeling a dull pain in my mind, and stashed it in my bag. "I guess it is. Huh. We should get to the town before the sun goes down, though." She nodded, "Yeah, you're right. Let's go." We ran to catch up to The Drifter, and the three of us walked through the orchard together, heading back towards the town.<br>
            <br>
            We got back to the town, and Alto pointed us towards Lance's house. The Drifter knocked on the doorframe, and Lance called out, "Dale told me, come in." We pushed through the cloth door, and Lance nodded at us. "Me and Kai managed to pull some other cushions over here, for you all. I have some food, as well." He gestured to a spread of cheese, bread, and fruit that had been set out on the table. Sophia and The Drifter approached the table, and Lance pulled me aside. He whispered to me, "Do you know me?" He asked, with confusion in his voice. I shook my head, "Not well, I can't remember anything." I remembered something that Xander had said earlier, and asked a question of my own, "Xander said you had a strange self-image, but he didn't get the chance to explain what he meant..." He paused, thinking. "...When he went into my head, for the amnesia, I wasn't a Jolteon." I interrupted him, excited, "Were you a human? Pale skin, coppery hair?" He looked a bit confused. "Is that what it's called?" I nodded, "I think, do you mind if I...?" He sighed, "Go ahead, it wouldn't be the first time today somebody rooted around in my head." I closed my eyes, trying to figure out what to do, since the only mind I'd entered had been my own. I examined the process by which I entered my library, but it didn't feel applicable to this. "Let me try..." I used telekinesis to pull the key out of my bag, letting the prickling pain center my focus, and pushed it into the air, the entire weight of my mind behind it. I turned it, and appeared in my library, though, oddly, I kept the form of a Espeon, and when I attempted to change it, I couldn't. The key was still hovering, relative to where I'd used it, so I focused my mind on it once again and used it to exit. I didn't feel like I had moved an inch, but Sophia and The Drifter had looked over, and Lance spoke, tone a bit panicked, "You... just dissapeared there, where did you go?" "What happened?" The Drifter asked, as Sophia voiced her own question, "What did you do?" The key clattered to the ground as I got distracted by the trio of questions. "Ok, One at a time. Lance: I went into my mental library. Drifter: I used a key that I found in my mind. Sophia: I used the key." The Drifter shrugged and turned back to their journal, looking over at the key periodically. Sophia looked a bit confused at my answer, "What, the key physically teleports you into your own mind?" I nodded, "Seems to be the case, yeah. I was trying to see if it'd let me access Lance's mind, but..." I shrugged, as best I could, "no dice." Sophia walked over as I picked up the key, gently, and set it on the table in front of The Drifter. "So, why were you trying to enter Lance's mind?" Sophia asked, looking at me. "I wanted to confirm something that Xander mentioned, about him having an odd self-image." I responded, "Would you please explain to me how you managed to enter my mind?" She smiled at me, "Of course. All you really have to do, really, is <em>push</em> against his mind." I entered Lance's mind surprisingly easily, his mind yielding easily to my request. I was standing in a cramped room, electrical projects piling around me, haphazardly assembled in piles and spread across a table in front of me. I heard Lance's voice behind me, "Seiko? Is that... you?" I turned around, eager to see if his self-image would match what I'd seen in that training memory, and saw the same person who I'd fought in my memory, and I smiled. "Yes, I am, and I think we have a history." He was a bit confused, but I ejected myself from his mind, opening my eyes to see him looking at me, just as confused as his self-image was. "What do you mean we 'have a history'?" He asked, "Is it a good or bad history?" I shook my head, "I don't know everything, but I'm ninety-nine percent certain we've trained together, before this." I gestured around with my tail, "It's a bit hard to explain fully, but we must've known each other, and had a good enough relationship to spar." My mind was working through what this meant. "I think we should stick together, at least for now." He and I said, in sync. "Creepy. It's like you two are twins or something." The Drifter said, not looking up from their notebook, "Also, if you are going to travel with us, we have a dress code." They pulled out two purple kerchiefs, tossing one to Sophia and one at me and Lance. They chuckled, "As well as that, Four is the legal minimum to be recognized as a guild, provided all four can make it to a guild registry in Market Town and the registrar accepts the guild application." They put away their journal, "So, would you all like to be apart of the official Drifter's Guild?" They asked, as Sophia tied the bandana around her neck. Lance leaned over to me, "Would... you mind putting that one on me? I... don't have hands." I chuckled, as Sophia answered, "Sure, I never felt like I fit at the Medic's guild, anyways. I'm usually just a volunteer who moves stuff around as needed in the Market Town hospital." I tied the bandana around Lance's neck, as he added, "Yeah, why not. Although, it'd suck to leave Appleton behind without anyone good with electrical work. Could we stay a bit longer so I can try to help Kai?" The Drifter laughed, leaning back. "We can, I wasn't planning on leaving Appleton until maybe a week out anyways, this is one of my favorite villages to stop by, Alto is such a great doctor, and Dale's got some interesting stories, when I can actually tease 'em out." I finished tying the neckerchief, and turned to The Drifter, "I've already given you my word I'd travel with you." They sighed, lying down. "Thank you, again. I'm sorry for lying to you." I brushed them off, "Don't be, I understand why you did, and you've apologized for it." Sophia looked curious at that, asking, "Lied about what?" The Drifter blanched, "I... forget I said that." I went over and nudged them, "You can tell them, I'd trust Sophia with my life, and I'm fairly certain Lance is a good friend." They sat up, "Are you sure?" They were nervous. They couldn't sweat, but it was intense enough that I was catching snatches of emotion. "It'll be fine, I wouldn't tell a soul." Sophia chimed in, and Lance came over, tone light, trying to banter with The Drifter, "I promise not to scream in horror that you're a monster." They paled a little more at Lance's comment, and he quickly added, "I'm joking, of course, I wouldn't tell anybody unless you gave the OK." The Drifter steadied their breathing, and Sophia walked over, "It's ok, you don't <em>have</em> to tell us." Lance interjected, "But I'd really like to-" I shut his mouth with telekinesis. "You don't have to tell them. It's your decision." Lance was shaking, trying to worm his way out of my telekinetic grasp on his mouth. The Drifter sighed, "I... don't want to lie to you all, especially if we're going to be founding members of a guild." Their form bubbled and shifted, condensing into that of a Hisuian Zorua. I let Lance's mouth go, and he was the first to speak. "You're so cute!" Lance was looking at The Drifter, and Sophia mirrored his reaction. "Such a small guy." The Drifter managed to look indignant, despite their smaller stature. "I love what you've done with the bandana!" Sophia said, and The Drifter started to transform back into a Decidueye. "There, I'm a Hisuian Zorua, that's the secret." Sophia giggled, "Don't worry, I wasn't going to think any less of you just because you're a little guy." She had walked over to one of the beds that had been moved into the house. Lance spoke to The Drifter, "Yeah, I'd fight anybody who did think less of you." The Drifter sighed, "Yeah, but-" I interrupted them, "These two are also amnesiac, they wouldn't have the cultural background for that to be a thought in their mind." Sophia added, "Also, I think I remember a Zoroark?" I nodded, "Yeah, I remember one too." Sophia yawned, "Anyways, I'm going to go to bed, g'night." She laid down on the bed, and quickly fell asleep. The Drifter looked around, "Hm. It seems you and Kai only brought in two extra beds." Lance sighed, "Yeah, we didn't expect Sophia to stay." The Drifter claimed the other unclaimed bed, sitting on top of the cushion. "Not my problem." They said, setting their bag next to them. "You two figure it out, I'm a bit fatigued from being zapped by a lightning bolt today." They leaned back, lying down. Within seconds, they were softly snoring. Lance looked like he had remembered something, and turned to me. "You... do amethyst, right?" He asked, moving over to a bag in the corner of the room. "Yeah, why?" He rummaged around in it, pulling out a pair of copper filigree rings. "Seeing that key of yours reminded me of these, do you know what they're for?" He brought them over and set them on the table next to the key. I examined one, picking it up with telekinesis and getting a good look at it. "Hm. It looks a bit like the key, you're right about that." I examined the inner face of the one I held, and saw strange glyphs, all of them hexagonal. "Do you know what-" I cut off in the middle of the question, as my mind had started to interpret the glyphs, translating them and revealing their function. It was a fairly simple script, meant to facilitate communication across distances. It was keyed to activate upon touching the largest amethyst. "...Can you grab the other one, and just hold it? I'm going to try something." He grabbed it, and I touched a paw to the amethyst embedded in the ring. It pulled at my mind, attempting to grab something. I thought of a simple message, 'Test, Test. One-Two.', and let the band take it, and Lance gasped, dropping his band in surprise. "I heard you speak in my head!" I examined more of the script, my mind translating meaningless glyphs into the overall function. "Hm. Well, it seems like I made this, and I made it to talk to someone. Where'd you find this?" He shook his head, "It was nearby me when Sam found me." I nodded, "Well, this certainly lends credence to the idea that we're associated." I said, and Lance interjected, "How did you know you made it?" I pointed to the script on the inside of the band. "I was able to understand this, so I at the very least knew how to make one, it's maybe a bit of a stretch to assume I made these ones, specifically, but I do have a memory of sparring with you, so it's definitely plausible." He nodded, "Ok, but why would I have both?" I shook my head, "I don't know, but you had no clue what the script did, right? So at the very least, I made these and gave them to you." He nodded, "Yeah, that makes sense. We should talk more tomorrow, it's past sundown. Keep that one on you, though. It'll be useful to be able to talk to one another." He grabbed his communicator ring, and set it back in his bag. I moved mine into my bag. "So, who are you going to sleep with?" Lance asked, "All of the beds are claimed." I used telekinesis to grab the key off of the table, "I have an idea, don't worry about me." It had physically transported me to my library earlier, so I assumed that was what it'd do. I let the key take my mind, forging it for its own purpose, and twisted it, ending up in my library. I thought about seeing what was outside, and a small projection appeared around me, showing the room I'd just left. Lance was a bit confused, but he shrugged it off and laid down on his bed, falling asleep. I set off towards my reading room, dragging the projection behind me, and conjured a bed, moving it in the air with me. I set the bed down in the reading room, expanding the walls slightly as I did, and compacted the projection until it was only slightly bigger than my head. I, belatedly, wished I had a method to tell the time, and a small clock appeared on the wall, with pictographs of the sun and moon on it, opposed, with a gradient of yellow and blue ringing it. The clock said that it was right after sunset, so I set my bag down next to the desk, now taller than me, and laid down in the bed. It was surprisingly comfortable for a mental construct, lulling me to sleep fairly quickly.<br>
            <br>
            I snapped awake, and looked at the clock. It was sunrise on the dot. I was a bit surprised I'd woken up at sunrise, but I wasn't complaining. I looked at the projection, and there were maybe one or two rays of sunlight filtering in the door of the house. The Drifter and Lance were still asleep, but Sophia was awake. She had seemingly also woken up at the crack of dawn and was looking around. I got out of the bed and used telekinesis to smooth out my fur, before grabbing my bag, slinging it over my shoulder, and using the key to emerge from my library, in the exact same spot I'd been the night before. "Ah! Seiko!" Sophia whispered in surprise, "Where were you?" I nodded to the key, as I slipped it back into my bag, whispering back, "Library, I didn't want to sleep with anybody, felt weird." She nodded, "How was it?" I chuckled, "Shockingly comfortable, for a mental construct. We should move outside so we can stop whispering as much." I moved towards the door, Sophia behind me, and we stepped out into the early morning. "So, what are you going to spend the week doing?" She asked, "I'm going to try to teleport back to Market Town and wait for you guys to get there." I thought about it, "Honestly? I'm a bit curious as to how rock-type moves feel to use, since I had that thing with the wire yesterday." She laughed, "Well, I've no clue what happened, since I wasn't there, but you did also have that cocoon that I believe you made around yourself." I nodded, "Yeah, I might have some talent for it. Gonna ask Dale how it feels for him." Sophia nodded, "Alright, well, I should get back to Market Town." She focused, "Ok, how did Xander say it felt like again?" She had her eyes closed, focusing, but nothing happened. I waited for a couple seconds, before asking, "...can you even teleport?" I would have checked the moves book, but it didn't contain information on what pokémon could learn any given move. She shook her head, "No, it should work, it's a psychic-type move!" We stood there in silence for a couple minutes, before I nudged her, "I... don't think it's working." She sighed, opening her eyes, "Yeah, but it's psychic-type! It just makes sense for me to learn it." I shook my head, "Well, some things just don't make sense. Mind Reader, the move, is normal-type." She looked at me, surprised, "Really? Shocker, that. Would've expected it to be psychic." I chuckled, "You, me, and The Drifter." She shook her head, "Guess I'll help out Alto, then. She could probably use someone helping her." She started off towards the Town Square, making her way to the small building that was marked with a blue cross. I decided to try out rock-type moves myself, since Dale was likely asleep. I started off towards the solar panels, grabbing an apple as I passed through the orchard, munching on it and enjoying the flavor, even if it didn't sate me. I reached the field, and found Dale there, examining the cable insulation I'd made yesterday. I called out to him, "Hey, Dale, what're you doing up at the crack of dawn?" He looked a bit spooked at my voice, and turned around. "Ah, heya Seiko, I was jus' lookin' over the wire here, makin' sure it was good. What move'd you use to make it?" I shook my head, "I don't think it was a move, exactly. I've no clue how to use rock moves, which is, coincidentally, what I came over to ask about." He chuckled, "Well, this is pretty good for someone who doesn't know how to use rock moves." He gestured to it with his head, "I don' think I could do this, honestly." I nodded, "Yeah, I think I could probably learn a rock move or two. I was wondering if you could explain to me how it feels to use a rock move." He chuckled, "It's a lot different from a psychic move, that's for sure. Every typin' feels somewhat different, honestly." He stomped his hoof, recoiling the cable. "It... hm." He looked off, thinking, "First, let's go over to the other side of the solar panels, don't wanna hit any of 'em and ruin Kai 'n Lance's hard work." He trotted over, talking as we walked, "Rock movres, and ground moves as well, both feel like... almost like connecting yourself to the rocks or ground around you, and usin' that connection to manipulate 'em." We reached the other side, and continued a bit into the grass, before he stopped and stomped his hoof. "For stealth rock, specifically, it's almost like I'm forcin' the rocks to stick in the air. Of course, I've gotten practiced enough with stealth rock that I can use it for much more than trappin' an area." Rocks levitated around him, "It also helps that I know multiple moves based around chuckin' rocks, like rock tomb. It makes my thinkin' a bit more flexible." He jerked his head, and the rocks flew forward, stopping midair, before shimmering and disappearing. "I want to see you try to use stealth rock, it's a good utility to have, regardless of circumstance." I thought on what he said, and the well of knowledge in my head chimed in with a supporting though, <strong class="corpus">Connecting yourself to an idea is the bedrock-</strong> It cut off, but I got the idea. I extended the geolocational sense I'd been struck with yesterday, letting it roll over the area around me freely, and I could feel... I could feel the rocks Dale had left in the air, but they were fuzzy and indistinct. I felt multiple clear chunks below me, and I extended that sixth sense into them, letting my mind pervade them. I focused on moving them up, burrowing through the earth. They began to move, bit by bit, each inch being a hard-won battle. "Seiko, I can see you're strugglin', take a second and let your strength return. It'll get easier with practice." Dale said, but I was committed to this. I'd see these rocks on the surface, I swore to myself. "Is... he supposed to glow green?" I heard Dale mutter to himself, distantly. I was the rocks, under the earth. I had to break free of the prison of soil I was in. They began to speed up, and the dirt around me churned, burying grass. One by one, small gemstones emerged from the earth, popping out of the ground and laying there. In all, about fifteen small gems littered the ground when I was done, and Dale nudged me, "You good?" I was breathing heavily, and I collapsed to the side, "Just give me... a second..." I was drained of energy, so I used my telekinesis with my final dregs of energy to grab an amethyst out of my bag and set it in front of me, letting the gemstone be consumed, feeling the energy rush back into me. It took me about a minute, but I'd consumed almost all of the amethyst, moving the seed back into my bag. "Wow, that... took a lot more than I thought it would, based on what I can piece together about making the cable." Dale chuckled, "You did go catatonic after the cable was finished, remember?" I laughed, "I did, huh." Dale looked at me as I got up, then asked a question, "I saw somethin' odd while you were doin' that, why'd your gem 'n leg glow green?" I looked at him, quizzically, "What do you mean?" He gestured to the small gemstones, "Try liftin' one without usin' telekinesis, and keep your eyes open." It sounded simple enough, I'd just unearthed these from the ground, so I reached out with my geolocational sense, and attempted to lift a gem. They felt sharp and clear to my sense, where the rocks and ground still felt indistinct and fuzzy. The small gemstone, recognizable as sapphire, lifted into the air, and I noticed what Dale had said was true. My amethyst arm had a faint green glow inside it, and I assumed the same was true for my forehead gem. I disconnected from the gem, letting it fall to the ground. "See? Yesterday, while you were makin' the cable, your whole body was glowin' a brilliant magenta, but today it's green." I chuckled, "Maybe it changes based on the day, I'm hoping tomorrow is red if that's true." Dale chuckled, "The amazin' rainbow Espeon, wouldn' that be a sight." He shook his head, "Anyways, take a small break, then try suspendin' the gems in the air." He looked at me, "Though, why gems? It'd've been much easier to use any old rocks, why pick those?" I looked at him, "It's a bit odd, but the rocks you suspended, and the rocks around here in general, feel... blurry." I shook my head, "The gems felt the clearest to my senses, so that's what I went with." Dale shook his head, "That's not normal, sure, I can feel the differences between rocks and their composition, but I've never heard of any ground or rock type who felt rocks like you do." He paused, remembering something, "Except for one, but..." He trailed off, "Who?" I asked, curiosity taking hold. "... There is a myth, about a pokémon made of pink diamonds, related to Carbink." He shook his head, "Diancie's not been seen by any pokémon alive today. I think you'd find her interesting, though, if you ever cross paths." I noted the name, and filed it away. "So, you're saying that my odd quirk in how I prefer gemstones is only shared by a pokémon of myth?" He chuckled, "It sounds a bit silly, but yeah, that is what I'm sayin'." He gestured towards the gems, "Anyways, you should try to get those floatin' in midair. That's the two big parts of stealth rock, gettin' the rocks, and makin' em stay in midair to shred whatever unfortunate pokémon isn't payin' attention. We can focus on camouflagin' 'em later." I let my mind invade the gems once again, feeling them bend to my intent, and moved them into the air, manipulating them over to a clear spot in the air. I willed them to stick, unmoving, and spooled my gemstone sense back into my mind. The gems dropped to the ground once my mind left them. "Jus' practice, it'll get easier and easier the more you do it." I decided to get a better feel for moving the rocks themselves, before I attempted to stick them in air. One step at a time. I motioned them to move through the air, and it felt like trying to move through syrup. "I'm gonna go check on Lance, see if he's awake so we can get started on installin' the main cable." He trotted off, leaving me to get a feel for manipulating the gems. They got easier to move as I conducted them through the air, so I set them down and began the process of calling more from the earth, sending my mind deep below and grabbing a particularly large gem. I worked it up, gradually, through the soil, taking breaks when I felt like I was about to collapse. The monotonous, repetitive motions of moving the dirt around the object I wanted to surface got easier, and I found my mind wandering, mu subconscious taking care of the fine details. A memory surfaced, and it was me, calling forth an amethyst from the earth. The minute, subtle movements of the earth around the gem were what I focused on, and the memory informed my technique. By the time the crystal was at the surface, I had drastically improved with manipulating things that weren't crystals, and my control over crystals had become even stronger than it already had been. I reached out, with my mind, to where Dale'd left his stealth rock, trying to see what he'd done to it, when a voice from behind startled me, breaking my trance. "Seiko, would you mind helpin' with the cable?" I recognized Dale's accent immediately, and he whistled, assumedly seeing the gem I'd unearthed. "That's a titanic cluster of evolution stones, would probably fetch a heck of a price at market." I turned to him, "Hi, Dale. It is a large stone, took me..." I paused, accessing the memory and looking for the time, "a couple hours to dig that one out." I hadn't looked at it, physically, I'd just seen it as one big gem. I realized I'd been wrong about that, it was a large, dense cluster of gems, with rock gluing them together. "You should take a break, then. We can figure out what these stones are and if we can profit off of 'em later." He chuckled, "You've got a heck of a talent, Seiko. Come help with settin' up the cable, if you could." He trotted towards the power box for the panels, and I followed. "Do you just need me to unwind the cable throughout the woods?" I asked, to which Dale responded, "Pretty much, you might need to hold it so Kai can splice it to the power box and apple press, too." I nodded, "Yeah, makes sense. Just telekinesis?" Dale nodded, "Yeah, give yourself a rest from working with rocks." We arrived at the power box, and I grabbed the coil of wire with telekinesis, conjuring a spool to keep it around midair. "Ah-" Kai said, and I saw a leaf fly towards me. Dale stepped aside, and the leaf hit my leg. It hurt, a lot more than I thought it could, and I half-collapsed from the pain. Somehow, the cable was still midair, my telekinesis holding. I heard a soft chant, and I was able to stand again. "Are you OK?" I heard Alto ask, as Kai called, "Runaway razor leaf!" He returned to working on something, as Alto hopped over to me, shoving a berry in my mouth. She checked where the leaf had hit me, letting out an audible noise of surprise, "This shouldn't cut a psychic-type like this, you sure it was a razor leaf?" She called the last part out to Kai, who affirmed, "Yeah, using it to splice cable." She looked at me, thinking, before asking Dale, "I loathe to ask this, but can you hit Seiko with a fighting-type move?" Dale looked at her in shock, "Why?" I said, at the same time as Dale. "Because, I have a theory. This is the easiest way to test it." Dale sighed, "Doctor's Orders." before kicking me with a hoof. It hurt, but it wasn't debilitating. I staggered back, but didn't collapse. Alto clucked, "Scale of one to ten, how much did that hurt?" She asked, before chanting under her breath. "about... a five?" I said, as she finished her chant and the pain dissipated. "Odd, usually, psychic-types are strong against fighting-type moves. You have a second type." Dale chuckled, "You mean the Espeon with a crystal leg has something odd with his typing? Coulda never guessed." Alto looked at him, before turning back to me. "So..." She thought, "...weak to fighting and grass... Must be rock. You, Seiko, are the first ever abberant eeveelution." Dale chuckled, "Have we ever had an abberant eeveelution?" Alto nodded, "Yeah, but something is affecting his typing. Well, you're a verifiable anomaly, Seiko. Congrats." I looked at her, "What's an abberant?" She chirped, "Abberant pokemon are those with new or abnormal secondary types, usually due to a genetic quirk or a deep understanding of the abberational type." Dale added, "Eevee are pretty good at pickin' a typin' conclusively, since that's one of the major steps in their evolution." Dale chuckled, shaking his head, "Wonder if Lance is a steel abberant, since his fur is metallic." Alto squawked at him, "Don't go using moves on him, mister. I'll get him in a test, and we'll see if he can get poisoned." Dale was laughing, "Don' worry, Alto, I wouldn't hit any of your patients without permission." She calmed, a little, then turned back to me, "Spur of the moment test, sorry for having Dale hit you." She gave me another berry, which I stashed in my bag. "I wonder if you have any other odd stuff goin' on." Dale said, absentmindedly, "We could get a bunch of different people to hit him, see if any ability triggers." Alto sighed, "I can test for both abilities at once, if you consent, Seiko." I nodded, "I'd like to know everything I can do." She nodded, and a small flame appeared between us. It flickered, dancing around, before flying into me. My skin felt irritated, itchy. She shoved a berry into my mouth, and spoke, confused, "Well... you don't have a standard ability. Synchronize would've burnt us both, and magic bounce would've reflected the flame back into me." The berry felt... soothing, somewhat, and my skin stopped itching. Dale chuckled, "Seiko's full of surprises." I nodded, "Ok, well, we can't test for every ability." She also nodded, "Yeah, we'd need a pokémon with trace to give a full breakdown." Dale interrupted, "It's great that we know your ability and typing is odd, but we can continue learning about your condition after we set up the wire." I nodded, "Yeah, I'll go unravel it." I walked towards the trees, unraveling the wire a bit more than needed to make sure I didn't accidentally pull it out of the power box. Kai ran over to me, and walked with me as I unraveled the cable. "Hey, are you ok? I saw Alto rush over to you after that razor leaf went wild." I nodded, "Yeah, apparently I'm part rock-type." Kai nodded, "Neat." He ran ahead, assumedly to the apple press, weaving through the trees and swinging off of branches for more speed. I was left alone with my thoughts, so I interrogated the corpus of knowledge again, scanning for anything useful. I replayed the line that'd popped up when I was learning to manipulate rocks, but it held no new information. I reflected on myself, then, and thought about what my ability might even be. It was definitely something to do with my mind, but what? Was it the conceptual-physical space in my head, the fact that I allegedly have complete control over my mind? I was puzzling over it, and eventually, as I got to the apple press, decided that it was probably what caused my arm to be made of amethyst. Kai called out to me, "Just levitate the end up here, I'll grab it and start splicing." I did as he asked, and he began working on it. "If you could hold it in place as well, that would be great." He sounded energized, almost happy, like he was doing something he loved. I held the slack cable in place, adjusting it as Kai asked, and felt my mind wander yet again. I was in my library, with the most recent book, of me calling forth amethyst, and I studied it, drinking in the minute details. It didn't give me a lot of new info, other than being able to place it on a timeline, as it lacked the amethyst arm. I came back to reality, and Kai called from his perch atop the apple press, "And done! You can let the cable fall now, Seiko, thanks." He hopped down, and ran off, assumedly to do something else. I released my telekinetic hold on the cable and started wandering back towards where I'd summoned the giant crystal.<br>
<br>
            I got back, and Dale was on the ground, his legs folded under him. He looked to be sleeping, but he got up as soon as I approached. "Alright, so, I want to see somethin'," He said, "Why don't you try to lift that big cluster of stones up, like you can with the smaller ones." It seemed doable, so I let my mind pervade the rock, and willed it to lift into the air. It was a monumental task, infinitely harder than taking it out of the ground. It raised maybe a couple inches before I slipped, sending it back to the ground. "Alright, alright. It seems like you're worse with the bigger rocks, which isn't uncommon." I nodded, "Getting this out of the earth was... not easy, but it definitely got easier faster." He chuckled, "You were just movin' the dirt to lift it up slowly, weren't you." It had felt like I was lifting the stone, but I realized that I'd been mainly moving dirt from above the stone under it, and letting that smaller movement do most of the work. Dale chuckled, "Don't worry, it just means you've gotta come at it different." He stomped, using stealth rock to pick up a couple more rocks, levitating them around him. "See, I find myself bein' really good at the big, heavy stuff. I had to work a heck of a lot more to get as fine control as I do with stealth rock." He spun the stones faster, "In addition, I had to learn stealth rock completely differently. I came at it, initially, like I was kickin' all the rocks into place, and forcing them to stick in an invisible wall." He sent the rocks flying forward, and they hit an invisible barrier, sticking in midair. "However, that's not very good for control, so I ended up hittin' an ally from time to time." He chuckled, "Let me tell you, the number of times I got yelled at in a dungeon is too high." He straightened, "But, I managed to overcome my initial predisposition and got really good at usin' stealth rock, so good, in fact, that I'm able to trap somebody, even if they're payin' attention." I looked around, and there were razor-sharp rocks suspended in midair around me. They flew away from me, landing in a pile next to Dale. "But, you should take a break from stealth rock for the rest of the day, I heard you're leavin' at the end of the week, so we have all week to get you used to rock-type moves." He chuckled, gesturing towards the clustered gems. "You should use that finesse of yours to separate the gems, and then we'll sort 'em into piles." I nodded, as the corpus felt... more decipherable. I definitely felt like the word finesse applied to me, and it had put some of the knowledge into perspective. "Ok, Let's do this." I used telekinesis to move the smaller gems I'd summoned first into a pile, and started using my geokinesis to chisel away at the rock binding the evolution stones together. It was calming, minute work. Dale had laid back down, and I joined him, letting my mind chip away, slowly, at the cluster. The layers felt like they flew by, and soon, I was at the core of the cluster. A large amethyst resided, with other gems trapped inside. "Huh." I said, to which Dale looked over. "What? Find somethin' interestin'?" He asked. I nodded, "Yeah, take a look at this." I said, using a combination of geokinesis and telekinesis to lift the crystal out of the pile of gems and rubble I'd slowly reduced the cluster to. "Huh, it almost looks like..." My mind flashed to the amethysts The Drifter had collected, and, as if on cue, they appeared. "What's happening here?" They looked at the pile of gems, "You guys find a mine or something?" Their attention finally landed on the giant floating amethyst. "Ah. That kind of looks like..." I nodded, "It does, yeah." I moved it over to the side, and experimentally consumed a piece of the gem, getting a fragment of a lesson. <strong class="corpus">Team... Important...</strong>. I nodded, "Yeah, this is definitely something related to me." Dale looked at me, quizzically, "How'd'ya reckon that?" He asked, to which I responded, "It looks like the amethysts that The Drifter had, and when I consumed one of those, it helped kickstart... a sort of... well of knowledge in my head." I paused, before continuing, "I believe I made said well of knowledge before I got amnesia, but I can't be certain." I turned away from the gem, "Though, I can examine it later, more important is sorting the gems that were around it." Dale stood, stomping a hoof, which caused the debris to siphon away from the gems. "Ooh! Cool rock!" The Drifter said, appearing out of seemingly nowhere and grabbing one of them and stashing it in their bag. Dale chuckled, "We should sort these, get an idea of the value you've unearthed." The Drifter sat next to the pile, grabbing stones one at a time, and examining them. "Pyrite. Garnet. Jasper. No Clue. Raw Electrum. Malachite." They were tossing stones into a pile behind them, roughly sorting them. I grabbed the malachite and raw electrum as they tossed it, and stashed it in my bag. "Hm?" The Drifter asked, "What do you need those for?" I responded, "Gut feeling." I then began to pluck amethysts out of the pile, and depositing them in a small cluster off to the side. "Oh, you mistook that one. It's not feldspar, it's bauxite." I said, as I was sorting the piles further, dividing by type. Not everything that had been in the cluster was crystalline, but a good amount of them were. I subdivided the piles into metal ores, which I hadn't thought I'd recognize, but I managed to recognize every ore that could be utilized. The second pile I sorted into contained mundane crystals, like quartz. The third pile consisted of mainly evolution stones, but there were some eviolite crystals and other miscellaneous stones that Dale recognized. Lance wandered over to us, assumedly done with whatever he was doing with the electrical work, and Dale warded him off. "Careful, we're workin' with unknown stones. Don't want you to have another reaction." Something stirred in my mind, not quite a memory, but I added, "Don't worry, I can remove all the quartz." Dale was a little shocked, "I didn't tell you..." I shook my head, "No, but it's a gut feeling." I took a break from sorting The Drifter's piles, and used my geokinesis to move the quartz crystals off to the side, dropping them in a pile. "That's getting easier." I said, and Lance wandered closer, catching a chunk of ore The Drifter had thrown behind them, and plopping it into the pile. "Silver." He said, "Dunno how I know, but that's silver." I chuckled, shaking my head, "Well, why don't you pick out the ores, we can get this done faster if you do." He nodded, and started plucking ore chunks from the piles behind The Drifter and popping them into the pile. I continued sorting the gems, and Dale was working on sorting the individual types of abnormal stones. "... Hell's this?" The Drifter said, holding up a small round gem. It looked like a marble, and had a small design suspended in the center, a swooping design. The stone itself was white, with the design in shades of light pink, reminding me of... "Kinda looks..." The Drifter motioned to Dale, "He knows." They looked closer at the stone, "It does kinda look like me, you're right." Dale looked a bit shocked, "That's... hm. I think that's a mega stone, though..." The Drifter tossed it over towards Dale, who caught it with stealth rock and examined it closely. "Yeah, I think this here is a mega stone, though it doesn't match any designs I've seen." He tossed it back to The Drifter, who stashed it in their bag. "Keep it, it's obviously associated with you, and who knows, we might even find a key stone." Dale went back to sorting the odder gems into piles, and The Drifter did the same.<br>
<br>
            We churned through the pile as a team, and by the time we were done, the sun was about an hour off of setting. "Well, now. This is a heck of a haul. Only countin' the evolution stones, I'd say it's worth around twenty-five thousand Poke." The Drifter let out a low whistle at the figure. "That's enough to fund the village for... what, a decade?" Dale nodded, "If we're lucky, yeah. And that's not countin' the light clay, eviolite, and unrefined mega stones. Also, I'd feel a bit bad if I didn't at least give y'all a slice for helpin' out, given we'd've never found this without Seiko, and you two helpin' sort made this a lot easier." The Drifter looked a little offended, "I couldn't-" Dale cut them off, "No, really, you've done a heck of a lot for this town over the five years you've been driftin' around." He chuckled, "Also, I heard somethin' about you startin' an official guild? I could probably put in a good word, have to go to Market Town anyways to sell all of this." The Drifter looked surprised, "Why'd your word be that powerful?" Dale pulled a golden kerchief out of his bag, and The Drifter looked awestruck. "What's that mean?" Lance asked, "Treasurer's Guild, or something?" Dale chuckled, putting the kerchief away. "Nah, it's my rescue team's old design." The Drifter interrupted, "Team Gold Standard, one of the most prolific rescue teams!" They shook their head, "I didn't think I'd meet a member, to be honest. Whole team disappeared after the guild collapsed." Dale chuckled, "Well, I don't think we were the best team, but we were one of the most diligent teams out there." Dale was somber, again. "Definitely not the best. Not if the guild collapsing under our feet was all it took to scatter us." He shook his head, "I can put in a good word for your character, it won't do much, but it'll help." The Drifter was ecstatic, "Thank you, Dale. Genuinely." Dale brushed them off, "Nah, it's nothin'. Least I can do for someone who's helped out the community as much as you." Dale had finished moving the profitable stones into a bag, picking it up. "Why don't you three move the rest of this back, and then take the night? You're still leavin' at the end of the week, no?" The Drifter nodded, beginning to fill up a spare bag Dale had produced with the quartz and amethyst piles. "Right, I'll accompany y'all to Market Town when you do leave, to sell this stuff." Dale started heading towards the village, flush with bags. I grabbed one of the other spare bags and started heaping the mundane gems into it. Lance took the bag from me when I finished moving the pile into it, and started heading off towards the town. I took a second bag and started heaping the metals into it, as The Drifter called out, "Seiko? What're you going to do with the big one?" I called back, "Telekinesis, I'll leave it somewhere and examine it tomorrow." They nodded, finishing with the quartz and amethyst, then started heading to the town. I finished with the metal, setting it on my shoulder, and grabbed the amethyst with a combination of geokinesis and telekinesis, again. I wanted to crack it open and see what lay inside, but I had committed to waiting until tomorrow, when I could better integrate and acclimate to the influx of information. When I got back to the village, depositing the bag and giant gem into a storehouse, the village was quiet. Sun had set, and that was taking its toll on me, with fatigue setting in. I made my way into Lance's house, and the other three were asleep. I let my mind be taken by the key, and entered my library to rest.<br>

            The next day, I went to grab the hunk of crystal. Now that I was actually looking at <em>it</em>, and not the stuff around it, there were more than just other gemstones inside of it. The amethyst was cloudy, so I couldn't make anything out. I carried it over to Lance's house and ducked inside, before I started to consume it. Knowledge flooded into the corpus, but it was going by too fast to make out. I caught snatches of words, whizzing by as they flew to their rightful resting place. I kept consuming the crystal, letting the knowledge flow into me. "It kinda looks like ice melting." The Drifter whispered behind me, but I kept consuming. A lot of the information, when I could catch it, was incomprehensible to me, missing other pieces that I couldn't know. I came out of the trance a bit later, when the sun had fully risen, and looked around. The house was empty, the other three going off to do their day-to-day tasks. I examined the items that had been trapped in the crystal, six distinct piles of them in all. One was a pair of massive leather gloves and a pendant, the crystal on which looked similar to the mega stone The Drifter had found yesterday, except blue, with the central design being orange. The second was a cloth band, with another similar gem, this one blue and black. The third item was a deep blue cloak with a sapphire brooch, it felt slick. The fourth item was a slightly charred leather helmet, unremarkable, if a bit oddly shaped. The fifth set was a pair of green glasses and three leather bags with straps. The sixth pile was strange. There were two ornate black daggers, wickedly curved, as well as a pin with a rainbow mega stone set into it. There was also a green crystal, oddly shaped, with a birdlike image in the center attached to a band. The glasses and pin itched at my mind, feeling familiar. The objects didn't inspire any memories, so I stashed them in my bag. I then remembered how my bag had stayed with me both times I had entered my library via key, so I gripped it, letting it twist my mind into a point, and entered my library. I checked my bag for the collection of items, and, lo and behold, they were all still in my bag. If I could store objects within my mind, why hadn't I found any? Surely I would've exploited this before I lost my memories, no? The physical objects had a distinct sensation in my mind, itching as if they didn't belong. It wasn't persistent, and it was almost comforting, in a way. I combed my mind for any similar sensations, and felt only one similar feeling. I rushed to where, roughly, I'd felt it. When I arrived at the location, the only thing, or rather, things present were two daggers, their blades made of crystal, with copper hilts wrapped in purple-stained leather. I grabbed them with telekinesis and moved to my reading room, depositing all of the items I'd found in seven distinct areas, corresponding to the groupings they'd had in the crystal, with one extra for the daggers. I physically exited my library, and then mentally entered it, taking advantage of the humanoid form I had when conceptually present in the library. I opened one of the books, at random, to see if I could pin down the sense of familiarity I had with the pin and glasses. I scanned the memory I'd landed upon, the one of the Zoroark and Decidueye sparring. It didn't feel like anything at first, but I scanned the memory deeper, focusing in on the details I might not have noticed at first. The Zoroark was wielding steel daggers in a pair, using them for subterfuge and deceit, but they felt awkward in their hands. I focused on the Zoroark's suit, landing on the lapels, where a rainbow stone was pinned. I slowly panned through the memory, as the portion in time I'd landed upon was indistinct, and caught a much clearer view of the Zoroark's lapel pin, which matched perfectly with the pin I'd found. I absentmindedly put a mental image of the Zoroark above their belongings, and focused on the Decidueye. He was stringing arrows, quickly, leasing them one after another. He took a savage strike from the Zoroark, and his leafy hood fell back, revealing the same green-rimmed glasses I'd found. Obviously, they were his. I put a mental image above them, and pulled myself out of the memory, examining the piles. Two of them had belonged to pokémon I knew, but... The Zoroark's pile lacked their suit, and the Decidueye had many more satchels and bags on them than the ones I'd gotten. I looked through the bags, finding berries and other medicinal items. I put the bags back and looked at the piles, thinking. Since I had found these, that meant that their owners had to have also been transported to this world with me, but the fact that I had them meant they'd been stripped of their items, but not all their items, since I only had some of the Deciueye's bags, and completely lacked the Zoroark's suit. I was lost in thought when a call from the physical world snapped me out of my library. "Ah, Seiko, I was wonderin' if you were awake." Dale chuckled, "You've been cooped up in the house all day, what've you been doing?" I looked at him, shaking my thoughts away. "Ah, I've been examining the stuff that was in that giant crystal. One second." I grabbed the key, and entered my library, quickly grabbing the couple of mega stone looking gems that I'd found before exiting. Dale looked at me, befuddled, "What'd you even do? Learn teleport or somethin'?" I shook my head, "I'll explain a little later, but can you identify these for me? I found them in the crystal." I levitated the pendant, pin, cloth band, and green crystal over to him, and he grabbed them from me with geokinesis. "Hm, this one looks like a Swampertite, Charizardite X..." He paused when he got to the pin, "This is a key stone, these are ridiculously rare, yknow." He shook his head, "The oddities with you, Seiko..." He looked at the green crystal, then shook his head, "It looks odd, but I've never seen anythin' like it." He handed me back the items, and I put them back in my bag, save for the pin, which I pinned to my neckerchief. "So, why d'you reckon two mega stones for random pokémon were in that crystal?" I shook my head, "No clue, but I recognized the key stone pin in one of my memories, so I assume that I knew a Charizard and Swampert at some point." Dale nodded, "Odd, that. Well, I want to see you get better at stealth rock. You've, again, spent half the day in here... doin' what, again?" I looked out of the window, the sun was at it's zenith. "Eating a crystal." Dale looked at me when I said that, "How d'ya even do that?" I pulled a small amethyst out of my bag and willed myself to consume it, it disappearing into my mind, leaving a small seed in its place, which I returned to my bag. Dale shook his head, "You're an odd one. Why d'you eat gems, if y'don't mind me askin'?" "I actually have no idea why, but it seems that if I don't consume amethyst, I end up going..." I sighed, realizing the pun, "psycho." Dale chuckled, before gesturing towards the door. "Cmon, let's go. You won't get better sittin' in here." He trotted out of the door, and I followed. I looked forward to another day of practicing my geokinesis, to be honest.<br>
<br>
            ==<br>
<br>
            I had some time to myself, the shared house empty, so, as I had done throughout the couple of days since Seiko had uncovered it, I pulled out the Spectre Stone and looked at it once again, grappling with the question that'd haunted me for a while. According to every source I knew, I should've evolved by now. I had gone and seen enough of the world, fighting and helping others, that I felt far more experienced than I really should have. I considered using the stone, it would be painless, easy. My father's words flashed through my mind, "Nothing ever comes easy for us." But... surely using the stone would let me evolve, right? It would be so easy to use, to see if the energy trapped within could propel me past this barrier I'd reached. My father had estimated it'd take me five years, my mother giving me a more generous three. I closed my eyes, trying to feel the threshold for evolution, comparing it to the energy within, but I felt nothing. I couldn't evaluate where I stood, nor could I perceive the gate which I was trying to pass. It was crushing, knowing I'd done so much and was still nowhere near my goal. Maybe making the guild wasn't the best idea, maybe I should just go back home and- "Hey, are you ok?" Seiko broke my train of thought, "You're radiating... some negative emotion, I can't get as good a read on ghost types, but you're really just throwing it out there." I hadn't noticed him enter, so I was still turning the stone in my wing, I put it away as he walked over to me. "Yeah, I'm fine." I said, standing up, "Why'd you come in here? Something go wrong with your training?" He shook his head, "Right. Follow me. Quickly." He exited the house and took off, running in the direction of the orchard. I followed, running behind him, and I called, "What happened?" He called back to me, "I don't know, but Dale needs your help, You'll see." We dodged through the trees, arriving at the other side. Past the far side of the solar panels, Dale was stomping around, spearing indistinct pokémon-like figures with stone edge. Lance was next to him, sending bolts into the figures Dale'd missed. I realized what'd happened, and rushed into the battle against the mystery dungeon spawn. I dodged multiple rocks thrown my way, weaving between stray bursts of flame and jets of water. I let the Decidueye disguise drop, feeling my form shrink and lighten. I sent balls of shadow at a faux Medicham, picking out targets weak to ghost. The thrill of battle took me, as I entered the complicated dance that was the battlefield. The doppelgänger pokémon slowly dissipated, being KO'd by our side. The tide of fakes receded, the remaining ones funneling into a new opening in the ground. Dale trotted over to me, as Lance collapsed on the ground. "How'd a mystery dungeon just pop up?" I asked, as Dale said, "Thank you for the help." We both paused for a moment, trying to decipher what the other had said, and he eventually replied, "No clue, it just burst open while Seiko 'n I were trainin' rock moves." He sent some rocks over towards the entrance, letting them hang there, hidden. "It's a real kerfuffle. We've gotta take care of it before it gets any bigger." Seiko walked over to the two of us, asking, "What was that? You just told me to go grab The Drifter and then started sending rocks towards those..." "Replicas." I supplied, "They're spawn from a mystery dungeon made to look and act like pokémon. They don't have spirits, though." Dale shook his head, "Yeah. A mystery dungeon has apparently been gestatin' beneath the village, and that" He gestured towards the hole in the ground, "is what happens when a dungeon gets mature enough." He shook his head again, "Usually, a cartographer would come 'n take a survey of the land every year, but this one musta sprouted up just after they came." He stomped a hoof, "How'd you all like to dungeon crawl?" He asked, as Lance approached. I adjusted my neckerchief, "This wouldn't be my first, though it would be the first with others." Lance sighed, "I... wow. That took a lot out of me." Seiko grabbed an apple from his bag and handed it to Lance, before replying, "We should get Alto or Sophia, we have..." He was calculating something in his head, "I want to say four attackers, Dale, what would you put yourself as?" Dale chuffed, "Good estimate, I'm somewhere between a defensive specialist and a damage dealer. We should have at least one supportive member, though." Seiko ran off, "I'll grab them, then!" He called, as I transformed back into a Decidueye and took stock of my bag. I didn't have anything uniquely useful in a dungeon, just general medicinal berries. Lance finished the apple, and attempted to toss the core behind him, but it hit and stuck to his fur. I carefully grabbed the core, but no electricity hit me, despite me accidentally brushing his fur. "Huh. You didn't shock me." I said, as I chucked the core into the orchard. Lance beamed, "I've learned to control it, somewhat. I still have no internal sense of how much electricity I have, but I won't fry anybody who accidentally brushes up to me." Dale chuckled, and Alto landed next to us. I transformed back, valuing the speed and agility over the ability to grab things easily. Alto was a bit panicked, "What do you mean there's a mystery dungeon near the village?" Dale shook his head, "Exactly as I said, entrance is over there." He gestured towards the opening. Alto sighed, "Ok, just... you need a healer, I assume?" Lance and I nodded, "We're a team of three and a half damage dealers." Lance said. Seiko and Sophia burst out of the orchard, running full tilt at our group. They slowed down before they crashed into us, and Sophia was breathing heavily. "Ok, so, cool and dangerous dungeon... we are exploring?" She said, through breaths. Lance gave Seiko a side-eye, "Why aren't you huffing and wheezing like she is?" Seiko blinked, "Uh..." "Asthma." Sophia interjected, "Also if I remember correctly, you're shockingly good at running." Alto muttered under her breath, and Sophia's breathing cleared after a couple seconds. "You didn't need to use wish for that, Alto." Alto shook her head, "I've used wish so much, it barely even takes any energy anymore." I looked at her, confused, "What?" Dale chuckled, "When you use a move enough-" I cut him off, "Yeah I understood what she said, but my moves book-" He interrupted, "What edition do you have?" "Seventh, but-" He chuckled, "The Eighth has a foreword about their move usage counters being inaccurate, some of the pokémon who volunteered were savants with their moves." I was dumbstruck, "... So I've been..." Dale chuckled, "Yep, although, now that you know..." I shook my head, "Yeah, yeah. Shaddup." Seiko shook his head, "We should go into the dungeon." Lance nodded, and Dale started trotting towards the entrance, everyone following behind.<br>
<br>
            We entered the dungeon in a tight group. The walls were shifting, changing, but they ceased once we fully entered the first floor. It consisted of a large central room, with three exits. The room was devoid of enemies or items, and we pushed on, picking the south corridor. It was only wide enough for us to go single-file, so Dale took up the front, and I took up the back. "The walls were moving, right? I didn't imagine that?" Lance asked, to which I answered, "Yeah, dungeon floors tend to shift when nobody's on 'em. That makes them unpredictable, and very dangerous for the unprepared." Lance, Seiko, and Sophia all nodded, then Sophia asked, "So... how does a dungeon come into being? Especially one that's right under a village." Dale called back, "I can answer that one, dungeons are formed around some object, and their sole goals in life are to protect that object and expand. Cartographers can feel the presence of these objects, but somehow this one musta... slipped under the radar or somethin'." He shook his head, "Either it grew monstrously fast, or the cartographer couldn't see it. Either way, that's a big problem." We reached the end of the twisting corridor, and entered into a small room with a pool of water at the end opposite the entrance. "Dead end." I said, turning around to lead us back into the corridor. Behind us was a fake Decidueye, with an arrow nocked, aiming straight for me. I took the arrow head-on, and felt nothing. It'd used a ghost type attack, so I decided to use one of my own. I sent a shadow ball hurtling towards the faux bird, and the attack crashed through it, dissipating its form. "Well, that's odd." Dale mused. "Yeah," I responded, "Usually you only see evolved pokémon later in a dungeon." I began taking us back through the tunnel, twisting and turning. A shadowy Houndour leapt at me, but Lance obliterated it with a thunderbolt midair. We reached the main room again, and picked the north exit. Dale'd taken the front back up, and I kept my attention behind us, this time, looking out for any more surprises. We got through the tunnel into a medium-sized room, and Dale immediately spotted the staircase. "Usually, a dungeon's core is at the bottom for a subterranean dungeon." He said, descending the staircase. The rest of us followed him, going deeper into the dungeon. We got to the next floor, and Dale spotted a staircase immediately. "That was... easy." Seiko said, his fur bristling, "I don't trust it." I shook my head, "Good instincts, but sometimes good stuff just happens. It's random chance." Dale shook his head, descending the second staircase, "Fox's right, stuff just goes right sometimes." I called after him, descending the staircase, "Fox?" He called back, "Th' Drifter is a heck of a mouthful, yknow? Have to call you somethin'!" I sighed, "You could pick a different-" Seiko chuckled, "Too late, Fox. That's your new name, now." I glared at him. "You're really cute when you're angry, yknow." Lance said, snickering. I huffed, and we arrived at the third floor of the dungeon. It mirrored the first floor, but there were two exits this time. I split off from the group, and looked down the first tunnel. It was fairly short, leading to a medium-sized empty room, most of it out of my view. "Hey, Dale? Have you seen any items at all?" I called, and I heard him respond from the other side of the room, "Nah, and it's puttin' me on edge." I called back, "Yeah, same." I ventured forward, into the empty room, and I was suddenly surrounded by various fake pokémon. They coalesced from the ground when I got to the center of the room, cutting off my exit. I moved immediately, dodging an attack, and felt time start to slow. Stop, and think. Try to find a way out of this. Stop, and think. Let the world freeze and let yourself stop, and think. I could use shadow ball, but that would clear one, maybe two pokémon before I got overwhelmed. "You don't have to take battles at a lightning pace, even if you're quick." My mother's words echoed in my mind, the memory dredged up by my ice-type mentality. "If you move without considering every option, you might miss the best solution." She was a beautiful Alolan Ninetails, her whispy, ice blue tails fluttering behind her as she spoke to me as a child. Her purple eyes looking at me, warmly. "Your father disagrees, of course, but you can always stop and think." Should I use shadow sneak? Jump around, target to target, dispatching them one-by-one? No, I'd get overwhelmed then, too. "Stop, and think." She breathed in, concentrating, and let out a slow breath. As she did, a shimmering aura slowly appeared around her, coalescing from the falling snow. It was iridescent, ephemeral. "That is the thesis behind every ice-type move, but it is also a useful skill to learn in general." I could use... I could... but... I was trying to find a solution to the monster house that had sprung up around me, when my zen was broken by a creeping sense of anger. I was just like any other pokémon, but I was treated as if no better than the mindless imitations spawned by a mystery dungeon. I was chased, heckled, and attacked for showing who I even was. I had to lie to the world, to myself, to even get by. It never mattered how much good I did, I'd always be hunted. The anger, the pure malice I felt at the clones, at the world seeing me as evil just because of my abilities, at my inability to feel my evolution flooded out of me, covering the room. The faux pokémon who hadn't been disintegrated by the initial attack were frozen in solid blocks of ice, most of them mid-attack. Dale trotted through the entrance leading to the main room, stopping upon seeing the scene. Seiko rushed into the room behind him, and ran over to me. "Fox, are you ok?" I tried to nod, but my strength left me, and I collapsed to the ground.<br>
<br>
            ==<br>
<br>
            I lifted Fox's unconscious body, and held it in the air behind me as I took in the room. I'd mostly ignored it when I entered, more focused on the burst of malevolent energy I'd felt from the room. There were false pokémon dotting the room, all in solid chunks of ice. They'd been frozen mid-attack, some of them raising rocks, others mid-leap. One of the chunks contained a Flareon, and it was seething, the ice around it melting. "We should... move onto the next floor." I said, "The staircase is over there." Dale nodded, "Quickly, before that ice melts." He walked over to the stairs, calling behind him, "Lance, you take the back, and shock anything that gets close." He descended, and I followed, towing Fox behind me. We descended into a large chamber, centralized around a box. I peered into the ambient media, and the box looked <em>heavy</em>. All of the energy in the room was being bent and sucked into the box. It felt like it'd crash through the floor and keep going, to the center of the earth. Dale whistled, "Musta caught the dungeon early, if it's only three floors." I set Fox down in a corner of the room, and went over to the box. "Careful, if the dungeon has anything else in its reserves, it's going to release it here." Dale called, and, as if on cue, six figures emerged from the shadows to attack. I jumped back, spreading a curtain of floating gems in the air between us and the figures. They clarified as they stepped out of the shadows, revealing them to be fairly complete copies of a Zoroark, Decidueye, Some large hulking fish, a tall, purple and tan mammal with ghostly flames coming out of it's back, a large dragon, and a small black quadruped with yellow markings. Seeing them, a memory forced itself into my vision. It was the Zoroark and Decidueye I'd seen sparring, along with a... the names occurred to me, a Hisuian Typhlosion, Charizard, Umbreon, and a Swampert. They were laughing, enjoying a meal together. The memory faded, and I found myself behind Dale. He grunted, "Yer lucky you have a team with you, otherwise your lapse in attention woulda gotten you hurt." I nodded, "Thanks." and started building a resonating screech in my mind, echoing it throughout my brain. I directed the psychic scream towards the copies, and two of them collapsed, the Swampert and Charizard. The Zoroark looked at them, then back at us, and raised a knife, pointing it towards us. It then fell backwards, disappearing into its own shadow. The Typhlosion rushed forward, but got shredded by the gems floating in the air, dissipating. It'd felt the least... complete. I flicked through the memory, briefly, and it lacked the large spear and leather armor the one I'd remembered had had. The Decidueye jumped up into the air, and loosed arrows at all of us, which Alto and Sophia blocked with translucent pink and blue barriers. Sophia looked over at Alto, "Protect?", Alto nodded, before starting to chant something under her breath, this one distinct from the chant for wish. Sophia's forehead gem glowed, and she called to me, "Seiko! Umbreon, Back, Five!" I wasn't quite certain what she meant, but I quickly realized as she followed up, "Four!", I turned my attention away from her, keeping the countdown in my mind, as I tried to grasp one of the fallen figures with telekinesis. I collected the Swampert, hurtling it upwards, the process taking roughly three seconds. I dodged to the side, the Umbreon's noxious purple spray missing me by a hair. Lance had sent bolts at the flying Decidueye, keeping it from launching any more projectiles. Sophia gasped out in pain, as the Zoroark slipped behind her and left a wicked cut in her side. It fell back into its own shadow, smirking at me. Alto finished her chant, then started another. I felt... protected by that chant, and I turned back towards the Charizard, who had gotten back up. It roared, energy pulsing around it. A shell of luminous energy covered it, and it cracked after a second, revealing the Charizard, now black and blue. Dale cursed under his breath, calling out, "Alto? That mega's a dragon-type!" Alto didn't interrupt her chant, nodding. Lance hit the Decidueye with a direct bolt, and it fell out of the sky, directly into the field of rocks that I'd set up earlier. It dissipated, leaving us with three. The Umbreon had dissapeared after missing me, and I felt something claw into my back. The Umbreon had leaped on top of me, and was trying to bite me, dark energy gathering in its mouth every attempt. I tried rolling on the ground, to get it off of me, but it held tight, claws ripping into my skin. I heard Dale shout, but I couldn't make it out, my fight with the Umbreon taking all of my attention. It sprayed a caustic purple liquid into my face, but it slid off of me, having no effect. I clawed at it, and it clawed at me, our tussle bloody, at least for me. The Umbreon got pulled off of me, and I saw Dale, gripping the Umbron by the neck with his teeth. He flung it upwards, kicking it as it came back down, which dissipated it. "Two more, you good enough to keep fighting?" I tried to stand, but I couldn't. I saw a figure emerge from Dale's shadow, and exclaimed, no real words coming out. He kicked behind him, and it nailed the Zoroark in the chest, sending it crashing into the field of floating gems, which shredded its form. I heard the cracking of lightning bolts, and Lance cheering, "Yeah! Take that!" Before a smack, and a thud. Alto rushed past me, and Dale stomped the ground. The Mega Charizard rushed past, before being speared by a stone spike from below. Alto let out a sigh of relief, then started chanting. I felt my wounds close up, and she came over and shoved an oran berry in my mouth. I ate the berry happily, as she rushed off. It took me a second, but I was able to stand, again. Alto was over Lance, and he stood back up, not too long after I did. We converged on the box, Sophia limping a little, and I used telekinesis to flip it open. Inside were six spheres, half white and half red, with a thin grey line bisecting them. They were each marked with small letters, C, Z, P, B, M, and U. "...What are these?" Sophia asked, breathing hard. Alto glared at her, "Go rest next to Fox, doctor's orders." She handed Sophia a berry, as she slinked off to go lay down. "I... have no clue." I said, loud enough for Sophia to hear. Dale shook his head, "Whatever they are, they're the core of the dungeon." He raised a hoof to stomp on them, but I stopped him. "No... they don't have the same weight as the box does." He lowered his hoof, looking at me quizzically. "What d'ya mean, weight?" He asked. "They don't have the same conceptual weight as the box itself does. It looks like it would crash through the floor." He shook his head, "Psychic-types. If you want to examine 'em, take 'em, but we have to break the core to kill the dungeon." I grabbed the six balls, and underneath was a folded suit, a set of leather armor, and more leather satchels. I grabbed those, as well, "They're related to the items that were in that big cluster." I explained, and stashed all the items in my bag. Dale stomped on the box, the wood splintering easily under his hoof, and the entire dungeon trembled. "That'll do it. We should be transported by the residual energy..." He paused, and I felt myself... warp and twist, accelerating on some incomprehensible axis, before appearing in the field where the dungeon had initially opened. "Now." He said, as everyone coalesced from blue light. Lance looked queasy, "I hated that..." Sophia looked better, but was still breathing heavily, and a cloud had settled over a spot, assumedly set up by Alto. Samuel and Kai were in the field, and Kai jumped back in surprise when he noticed us. "Where-" Kai asked, and Dale gestured to the ground, "There was a dungeon here. Took care of it." Kai was still bewildered, "So there was a dungeon that the cartographer's guild didn't see when they came?" Dale nodded, "Yeah, I'm going to give them a report of what happened, since that really shouldn'ta happened." Samuel had dug into the ground, and popped out next to Dale, "It's really gone, huh." Dale nodded, "Stops the kids from accidentally wandering into it." Samuel deflated a little, before slithering off towards the village. I noticed that the sun was about an hour off of setting. "We weren't in there that long, were we?" I asked. Kai nodded, "Yeah, you all have been gone for about half the day." Dale nodded, "Time's a bit wonky in dungeons, somethin' about the core item bein' imbued with a buncha power warps it." I nodded, "It had looked like a black hole, almost. It was absorbing energy from the air around it. Makes sense it'd warp time." I shook my head, "I don't think absorbing is the right word, but it's the closest I can think of to describe what happened." "We should get goin', I have to pack up all the goods for our trek to Market Town tommorow." Dale said, starting to make his way towards the village. Lance nodded, "Yeah, just let me make sure Alto and The Drifter are ok." Lance walked over to the cloud cover, and dissapeared into it. Kai and Sophia followed Dale, but I laid down, calling out to them, "I'll walk back with Lance, when he's done."<br>
<br>
            ==<br>
<br>
            I entered the mist, and was met with Alto feverishly working on Fox's unconscious body. "Are they... ok?" Alto didn't look up, "I have no clue, Lance. They're likely going through something, mentally, but I can't help with that. They've been freezing, though, and their extremeties are showing symptoms of frostbite." I nodded, "I can grab something, if you need me to." Alto waved me away, "Grab Seiko, he'll be useful to help move them back to the village, where I can utilize the stuff in my clinic." I ducked out of the cloud, and gestured Seiko into it. He stood up, and we both entered the mist. "What do you need me to do?" Seiko asked, and Alto gestured at Fox's body, "Lift them, we're going to my clinic." Seiko nodded, and Fox floated into the air, the mist still covering them. Seiko started moving towards the village, Alto and I following.<br>
<br>
            ==<br>
<br>
            A tempest, voices swirling around me, their words lost to the cacophany. The souls of the dead surrounding me raged on, a torrent of emotions. I was lost, seeking something that I couldn't remember. The wind whipping at my fur was biting, chilling me to the bone. I continued to search, squinting through the dense white and pink mist. One of the spirits, more substantial than the others, appeared before me. It took a hazy, unclear form, roughly circular. It spoke to me, its voice eerie and feminine, "What leads you here, child?" I shook my head, the words forming from my mouth automatically, "I know not, for I wander." The ghost appeared to laugh, "Then drift along, young illusionist." It dissipated, leaving me with nothing. I kept searching, the mist continuing to bite at me, as other spirits manifested. "You must crush your enemies, leave them with nothing!" "Where could the destination be? Is it here, or there?" "The journey must not be the destination, no no no." Their voices cut through the maelstrom, but I ignored their cries, as they were not what I was looking for. I could feel it in my soul, I was looking for something distinct. I would surely know what it was when I saw it. "Hate them, crush them, kill them all with your malice." I looked at myself, and I was slowly freezing. The chill that had seeped into my bones was spreading from them, numbing my paws. "Wake up,' One spirit said, "Please." I had no clue what it was talking about, as I was awake, wandering through this storm of souls. I could no longer feel my legs, but I kept wandering, searching. I looked for a bag on my self, but I couldn't find one. It would've been useful to have a light source, but I could do without. "You are nothing. You will be nothing." "Please, psychopomp, take me!" "Keep going, you're getting closer." "Willow... I'm sorry..." The thoughts, feelings, and voices of the dead kept intruding on my mind, forcing their words into my awareness. The voices felt impossibly far, yet right next to me at the same time as distance stretched and compressed. I had traversed a continent, yet barely moved. I continued to search, seeking that piece I couldn't remember. The creeping chill slowly took over my body, numbing it. I saw a glimmer, and started to rush towards it, as the chill intensified. I was freezing, cold, so cold. My legs locked up before I could get close enough to make out what the glow was. I fell over, the chill taking over my body, and ice slowly took over my field of vision, the frost blinding me. My vision was completely taken over by ice, and I knew I had been frozen solid. The glow receded, swallowed by the fog. I heard the voice from earlier laugh, lightly, and it spoke, "Child of lies, you need worry not, for you and your allies have my favor." Its voice felt warmer, more caring, and it laughed again, "You won't lose yourself to this anger, yet." I felt myself warming, thawing. "Just remember, The Moon smiles upon you." The presence that the voice held dissapeared, and I stood, noticing a small golden card at my feet. I tried to pick it up, but I was suddenly somewhere else.<br>
<br>
            I was lying on my side, under a thick blanket, with a small bowl of milk next to me. I sipped from the bowl, and it was warm. I shivered, and heard a male voice say, "Alto, they're awake!" My mind was working overtime to remember the voice, as it felt familiar. I couldn't place it, voices still whirling in my head. "Fox, do I have your consent to try something?" The voice asked. It didn't feel agressive, and my gut told me to trust it, so I went with it and nodded, weakly. I felt a presence brush against my mind, before it struck at my mind, trying to worm its way into it. "Don't worry, I won't do anything to hurt you, Fox." The voice said, so I stopped resisting the intrusion into my head. Something slipped into my mind, and the voices lessened, my thoughts more coherent. "I've had to deal with overload, so I'm just blocking out the majority of the input by force until you can handle it yourself." The voice said, "I'm also saying this out loud so you and Alto know what I'm doing, since it isn't exactly obvious." It was Seiko, I remembered. I looked over at him, and his eyes and gem were glowing magenta. "What did you even do?" He asked, and the glow lessened. "I... don't know." I said, "I can't..." He nodded, "Memory and dreams are related, and from what I can feel, you just had a hell of a dream." I nodded, and he continued, "Don't worry, I can't see anything specific, just vague ideas." Alto popped up, feeding me a berry, "How did you manage to give yourself frostbite?" She asked. I swallowed the berry, then responded, "I..." Seiko's eyes glowed brigher, and I found it easier to remember. "I... think I used some move. I was in an ambush, and..." The memory hurt, as I recalled the rage exploding out of my body. "I was so... angry, full of hatred..." Alto nodded, "Sounds like a move, alright. Do you recall it from your book?" Seiko and I shook our heads, and she sighed. "I'm going to lessen my presence in your mind, prepare yourself." Seiko said, and I felt the voices creep back in. They shouldn't be there, the voices of the dead. I pushed the rogue spirits out of my head, and Seiko visibly recoiled, his eyes returning to their regular, non-glowing amethyst. "Agh- you just pushed me directly out, huh." He said, chuckling. "Well, that just means you're recovering well." Alto nodded, "I'm keeping you here, for now." I recalled something from my dream, and looked into my bag, spotting a gilded card at the top of it. I pulled it out, and Seiko's eyes widened, and he examined the card closer. "...this feels..." His eyes glazed over, and he muttered, seemingly unaware that he was speaking, "Eighteen, The Moon." He was in a trance. "Fear, Madness, Creativity, Inspiration, Illusion. Those are the ideas this card symbolizes. I, personally, associate it with fiction, as that unites all of the other ideas." He shook his head, "I have never pulled this card, myself, but it is still one of the Major Arcana." He snapped back to reality. "I... hm... Excuse me, a moment." The ornate key slid out of his bag, and he turned it in midair, dissapearing. Alto was a little shocked, but I shook my head, "He can do that, don't worry." She shook her head, "Guess he's weirder than I thought." I examined the card, it was intricate, made of paper plated with gold, the art done mostly in shades of gold. It depicted a large silver moon, with light shining down on a foxlike figure. Upon closer inspection, I recognized it to be me, in sihlouette. Across the bottom was a solid line with the number eighteen engraved into the card. Seiko reappeared, and held up a gold and purple box with his telekinesis. "I remembered where I had <em>this</em> when I saw that card." He opened the small box, revealing a deck of cards inside. It didn't fill the box, leaving a significant empty space. "Most of these are minor arcana, but I'm missing all but one of the Major Arcana." He took out the deck, shuffling it, eyes closed. He flipped the top card, and it revealed a card with the number one. "The Magician, representative of innate potential and talent." The card was done in the same style as the one I had, except the art depicted a bipedal figure, using a crystalline arm to write glowing figures in midair. The symbols and arm were done in purple, similar to how the moon broke the monochrome gold on my card. A question occured to me, "If these are done in the same style, and you had that one in your library..." He nodded, "I have reason to believe that I owned a full tarot deck at one point." I shook my head, "I was implying this was likely yours, but that could be possible. Do you know how many you're missing?" He shook his head, "At least sixteen, for cards two through seventeen. I know that I have every minor arcana, since they follow a similar pattern to a standard fifty-two card deck." He thought for a second, "I can't imagine there'd be only eighteen, since the minor arcana are divisible into four suits. twenty, maybe? Evenly divisible into the suits, but..." He looked at The Magician, "There's no wands, cups, coins, or swords on this one..." I interrupted him, shaking my head, "I've never heard of these Major Arcana." Seiko shook his head, "They're..." His eyes took on a yellow sheen, his voice seeming... futher, like someone speaking through him. "Symbols, ideas. Put into cards and used to understand the world." He shook his head, "The twenty-two Major Arcana are large, significant ideas, but the fifty-two minor arcana should not be discounted." The yellow glow vacated his eyes, and he looked queasy. "...I feel like I just..." He shook his head again, "How do I even explain it? It felt a bit like shifting into the mindset of using a move, but it didn't release the energy in that manner..." I looked at him, head tilted, a bit confused, "Did it feel almost like speaking with someone who isn't there, a presence that takes up your mind yet leaves it entirely empty?" He shook his head, "Kind of, yeah." I let out an audible gasp, if he had... "I think you might have spoken to a spirit, or something similar. I've only done it once, but speaking to a single, distinct spirit feels like that." I shook my head, "You obviously didn't speak with a ghost, I would've felt its presence if you had, but you did something similar." He nodded, "Well, whatever it was I... communicated with, it knew a lot about the tarot, and I can... somewhat recall it." Alto sighed, and interrupted us, "This is great and all, but <em>you</em>" She pointed at Seiko, "Need to get sleep, and <em>you</em>" She pointed at me, "Should rest and recuperate." Seiko nodded, and I attempted to give him The Moon, "It's yours, obviously." He nodded and took it, before vacating the room. "Get some rest, you almost died of hypothermia." Alto said, "No amount of wishing can save you from that, Fox." I tried to laugh, but she shook her head, "I was preparing to take care of a comatose patient, Fox. I don't want an- any patient of mine to die." She had caught herself, there, but she shook her head, "Sleep, for now. You should be well enough to leave for Market Town, tommorow." She exited the room, leaving me alone with my thoughts, and I focused my form to that of a Decidueye, feeling my body warp and shift like warm wax, and pulled out my sketchbook. I flipped to a clean page and started to sketch what I remembered of the two cards. They wouldn't be perfect depictions, but... My thoughts trailed off, and I found myself drifting to sleep, thinking of home.<br>
<br>
            ==<br>

            I stumbled into Lance's house, and the other two were fast asleep. Lance'd left the clinic when we got there, and he'd fallen dead asleep seemingly as soon as he got to his bed, his bag still on him. I carefully extricated his bag from him, careful not to wake him, and set it on the table. I drew out my key, letting the pain focus my mind into it, and letting the will of the key twist my mind to a sharp point, before stabbing it into the air and twisting, appearing in my library. I set the deck box on the reading room desk, and exited the small room. I hadn't noticed before, but after I'd really started training with Dale to improve my geokinesis, the usually dominant purple of my library had started to be accented by a rich, deep green. I looked around, more, and noticed rare gold accents accompanying the green, the yellow metal mostly found in trims and small lines. The green inspired... a sense of steadiness, of gravity and hardness. It felt like the earth itself, almost. By contrast, looking at the gold felt like I was peering into an everchanging, flowing stream. My thoughts, looking at it, were those of the future, the present, and the past. I knew what the present held, but the past and future were shrouded, mysterious to me. I tore my eyes away from the river, and made my way back to the reading room. On the construct of a bed laid a single, gold card. The frame noted it as the thirteenth card, but I couldn't place the number to the card itself. The strangest thing about the card was the fact that it lacked art, in the place where the other two had had depictions of Fox and I was a flat golden field. I dismissed it, placing it on the table, and went to sleep, my consciousness fading as soon as I hit the bed.<br>
<br>
            When I awoke, I inserted the blank card into the box and set it in my bag. I exited my library to Lance and Sophia discussing something at the main table. "It's a little weird that they just... showed up, you know?" Lance said, before taking a bite of the cheese infront of him. "Yeah, but that isn't indicative of malicious intent, <em>we</em> just appeared in the world one day, after all." Sophia countered, before turning to me, "Seiko, what do you make of these?" She gestured to two golden cards on the table, and my mind immediately converted them to their meanings. "The Chariot, seven. Sign of physical strength, conflict, and war." I said, unconsciously, "and The Sun, nineteen. Represents optimism, joy, and accomplishment." Lance choked a bit on his food, "How'd you get all that from some pretty cards?" I shook my head, "Major Arcana, part of the Tarot, and this makes five that I've found in one day." I pulled the deckbox out of my bag, and took out The Moon and Magician cards. "I am fairly confident they're mine, but they've been showing up, seemingly at random, around others." Lance counted, and then asked, "I see four, didn't you say five?" I nodded, "Yeah, but the fifth one, numbered thirteen, is blank. No art." I looked at the two cards, and found myself admiring their art. The Chariot depicted a man, recognizable as Lance, holding out a javelin infront of him, point forward. The javelin was copper, which tracked with the other cards having some non-gold elements. The Sun was similar to The Moon, but instead of a silver moon, it depicted a golden sun, shining down on a pink Espeon, recognizable as Sophia. "Well, all the cards with art I've found have had one of us on it." I said, and the other two nodded, "I see what you mean." Sophia said, and Lance asked, "Well, why do they have our mental self-images on them, instead of our physical forms like Sophia's and Fox's?" I shook my head, "From what I and Sophia can remember, we aren't pokemon, at least not originally." Lance shook his head, "Odd. I don't feel like I'm uncoordinated, though. Wouldn't I have had trouble walking if I suddenly changed from a biped to a quadruped?" Sophia shook her head, and opened her mouth to speak, but I interrupted, "Actually, remembering my first day, I had an odd thought. One of my first thoughs, ever, was that I definitely hadn't fallen asleep as a quadruped." Sophia was shocked, at that. "What, are you some sort of shapeshifter?" She asked, and I nodded, "It'd explain my thought, and why we didn't have to relearn how to walk when we woke up." I grabbed the other two cards, sliding them into the deckbox, and returned it to my bag. "Existential questions about our pasts aside, are you guys ready for our trek to Market Town?" I asked, and Lance nodded, "Yeah, everything's in my bag." Sophia also nodded, "I don't have much, as everything's in my home at Market Town." Fox, in their Decidueye guise, peeked their head through the door. "You all ready? Dale's just loading his goods onto a cart, so we can leave fairly soon." Sophia looked at them, "Are you doing ok? You looked like you were doing horrible yesterday." They nodded, "I feel fine, yeah. Cmon." They dissapeared from the door, and we all exited the house. Fox pulled me aside, and asked me, "Seiko, does... does the phrase 'The Moon smiles upon you.' mean anything to you?" I looked at them, confused, "No, why?" They shook their head, "Probably nothing, it's the only thing I can remember from when I was passed out yesterday." They looked off at Lance and Sophia, "Again, probably nothing, but..." I nodded, "It's strange, so it sticks with you. I've had my share of strange things happen, so I kinda just have to roll with them. If anything does happen, you have a guild with you, remember that." They nodded, "Yeah, I guess I do, huh. Thanks, Seiko." They ran off to join the others with Dale, and I meandered my way over to the storehouse I'd put the raw metals in. I grabbed the bag, and used my key to store it in my library, before running over to where Dale was finishing up loading a large, fabric-covered cart. "Hey, Seiko." He said, "I reckon there's enough room for all y'all in the back, with the apple products. I can pull all y'all and the products, don't worry." Fox hopped up into the cart, and pulled out their journal, beginning to write. "I'll walk, wouldn't want to make you pull me along." I said, and Lance nodded at that. "Nah, it's nothin', I could probably pull one of the village houses along in a cart if I really wanted to." Dale said, chuckling. Lance shook his head, "I'd rather get the exercise, to be honest." I nodded at that, "I won't get too winded. Tired, maybe, but not winded." Sophia shook her head and hopped in the back of the cart, saying, "Speak for yourself, I'd rather not collapse into a wheezing mess." She curled up next to Fox, and they pulled their journal into an angle she couldn't see. Dale chuckled, "You do you, then. Let's go." He pulled the harness infront of the cart up and onto himself, and started trotting along, the cart rolling easily, if a bit bumpy, behind him. Lance and I walked next to him, and we began to chat about different things, mostly Fox and Dale sharing stories of their escapades into dungeons, with Me, Lance, and Sophia listening, rapt.<br>
