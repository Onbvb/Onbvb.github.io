        <p>
            Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Seikosis is... odd.<br>
            It began with Seiko, and his world.<br>
            His world being an urban fantasy setting that I've developed on-and-off for a while.<br>
            (Fun fact, he started life as a minecraft skin, as most of my original characters have.)<br>
            I love him, and his world, but back to PMD:S<br>
            It takes themes and ideas from the real PMD games, but it doesn't end up following any of them beat-for-beat, unlike many other (great) fan works.<br>
            I've stolen other ideas that break tradition from a really wonderful comic called <a href="https://onborrowedtime.thecomicseries.com/comics/first">PMD: On Borrowed Time.</a><br>
            It really... kicked me, mentally, into writing PMD:S. Go read it. It's great.<br>
            Most of the <a href="characters.html">characters</a> have their own tidbits about how they came into being, but that's on it's own page.<br>
