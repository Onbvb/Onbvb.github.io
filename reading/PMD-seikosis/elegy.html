    <h1>Interlude: Elegy</h1>
    <p>
        Alto sighed, watching Fox's makeshift team and Dale make their way through the forest towards Market Town. She turned back towards her clinic, stepping into the empty building and letting her mind wander. <em>I almost slipped, with Fox.</em> She thought, <em>I don't want them worrying about my problems. This is my burden, and my burden alone.</em> Her eyes drifted towards the small portrait of her and... him. She should've really moved that back into storage, with the rest of his things, long ago. <em>I wonder, sometimes, if you're proud of me.</em> She moved to pluck the portrait off of the table, but stopped. It felt wrong, to bury his memory as she had, but it was the only way to move forward with herself. She sighed, leaving the portrait there. "...I just have to keep moving. Keep pushing forward so that I don't halt completely." She muttered to herself, turning to the door she knew would hold someone else in need of healing. Surprisingly, it was empty, nobody having needed her healing as of yet. Kai was being more careful with his electrical work, having learned... something from Lance, despite the amnesia. Samuel hadn't found his way into any situations, not like the Dungeon from yesterday. Arceus... the Dungeon. It had been a terrible experience, dredging up memories she didn't quite want to have at the front of her mind. She'd managed to suppress them while they were delving, but it was painful. <em>It shouldn't have been him... it shouldn't have happened like that, how did everything go so wrong?</em> She thought, before shaking her head. <em>Can't let myself be bogged down like that. Keep moving, keep healing.</em> She moved around the room, preparing it to recieve another patient, now that Fox had been cleared for release. She picked up the latest letter from the Medic's Guild, and threw it into the growing pile of trash. <em>I can't accept. I don't deserve to be a Medic.</em> She thought, shaking her head. <em>They don't lose patients.</em> She swept the pile up and into a trashcan, setting it into another room to empty later. She worked through the room until it was perfect, then sat behind a small desk, waiting for someone to arrive. Her mind was still stuck on the portrait, and she found herself remembering that day.

        "C'mon, Alto! We're nearing the hundredth floor!" Treble said, and Alto nodded. "Yeah, just let me catch my breath." She was exhausted. They'd been exploring The Grand Cloudbank, at his request. Ninety-nine floors after entering the imposing mass of clouds, they'd reached the final staircase. "It'll all have been worth it, Alto. We'll learn so much from this." He'd been set on getting to floor one hundred, following rumors of tremendous power he'd read of somewhere. Alto sighed, following behind him as they climbed the final staircase. The small Chatot was twittering to himself as they continued, a song that Alto recognized, whistling along. They made their way through the floor, Treble striking down faux pokemon who got in their way. Alto was at the end of her energy, with Wish at one use remaining, but she wasn't too worried. It was the last floor, after all. Alto was watching Treble, making sure no enemies got the jump on him, when she felt a sharp, stabbing pain in her back. She cried out in pain, causing Treble to look over at her. "Alto!" He cried, turning to move towards her. He started to fly over, but her pendant activated, harnessing the energy of the dungeon to transport her out to safety. She saw Treble take a nasty lightning bolt as the energy pulled at her. His pendant was ripped from him by the blast, sinking into the soft cloud floor a bit away. She cried out to him as he staggered away from the faux Wattrel, badly injured. She chanted under her breath hurredly, infusing the words with yearning for safety, feeling the Wish take hold as her vision blanked out.

        She awoke with a start, quickly flapping into a standing position as she looked around, panicked. "Treble? TREBLE?" She was on the ground, having been transported away from the dungeon by her failsafe. The Chatot was nowhere to be seen, and she started thinking to herself. <em>No, no. He had to have used the recall orb, he had the bag. Surely...</em> She tried to take flight, but collapsed as soon as she was a couple feet off of the ground, landing with a thump. Her whole body was still sore from whatever attack had taken her out of the fight. <em>He can't have-</em> She was beginning to break down, getting more and more panicked each second Treble didn't appear. She looked to the sky, where The Grand Cloudbank lingered. She'd been deposited right underneath where it had been when she'd fainted, but it was drifting even now. It lazily moved across the sky, driven by the wind. She lay there, collapsed on the ground, watching The Grand Cloudbank move away from her. She was exhausted, but she couldn't rest, not if he was still- She felt a Pokemon nudge her from behind. "Hey, you alright?" She shook her head. "Treble, he's-" The Pokemon cut her off. "You don' seem to be doin' well. You can tell me about it back in the village." She heard the pokemon call to somebody else. "Kai! Can y' help me with this Altaria?" Alto blacked out again, as she felt somebody pick her up. She came back to in a soft bed, looking at a Mudsdale and Grovyle. "Ah, good, yer awake." The Mudsdale said, "My name's Dale, can y' fill me in on what happened?" Alto was still panicked, and tried to get up, but the Grovyle held her down. "Hey, hey, calm down, will ya? It's alright." Alto shook her head. "No, no it isn't! Treble- oh, Arceus, he's still in there-" Dale shook his head. "You aren't in a state to fly. Can you talk to be about what happened?" She knew she wasn't in a state to fly, she was training to be a Medic! It didn't matter, she had to get back in there and <em>help him</em>! Dale shook his head. "Slow down, I take it you were in a dungeon? I saw the light from whatever y' used to get outta it." Alto nodded, but didn't stop trying to escape. "Hm..." Dale was thinking out loud. "There ain't a dungeon there, accordin' to the Cartographer from last week. Was it a Grand Dungeon?" Alto nodded again. "The Grand Cloudbank, yeah, but Treble, he's-" "Still in there, you said. Odds are, he'll be fine. It's no use goin' back in unless you know he's in the first couple floors." Alto sighed, and stopped struggling. "Th' Grand Dungeons don't tend to kill Pokemon, not unless you go real deep. How far'd ya manage to get?" The Grovyle held an oran berry up to Alto's mouth, and she ate it. "Floor one hundred." She answered, finishing the berry. "That's impressive! How many'd you bring in?" Alto shook her head. "Just me and him." Dale laughed. "You've gotta be jokin' with me, I can't believe that two Pokemon managed to get that deep in a Grand Dungeon." Alto shook her head. "Yeah, we managed to get that far." Dale quirked his head. "Can y' tell me more? I'm really itchin' to know how that happened." Alto shook her head. "I've been training to become a Medic, and he's been looking into various rumors trying to become an investigator of sorts." Dale nodded. "Interestin'. Are you calm, now?" Alto nodded, sighing. "Good. It's no use goin' back in and potentially dyin'." Dale said. "Again, he'll probably survive, but... I've only been in one Grand Dungeon, so..." Alto sighed. "I... guess you're right." She hadn't noticed that she'd been crying, but the Grovyle handed her a handkerchief. She dabbed at her eyes, getting out of the bed she'd been set in. "You mentioned you were training to be a Medic, right? We could <em>really</em> use one of those." The Grovyle said, and she nodded. "I mean... I guess I can help..." Alto didn't have much of a home to go back to, and she couldn't face Treble's family. "Well, welcome to Appleton, then." Dale said, leading her out of the house they'd been in.

        Alto snapped back to herself, noticing Kai waiting patiently on one of the chairs. She fluttered to a stand, squawking. "Oh- Kai, I'm so sorry! Wha-" Kai waved, cutting her off. "No, no, it's fine. Thinking about Treble again?" She nodded, and he continued. "You had that same look in your eyes that Dale gets when he talks about adventuring." Kai let out a small laugh. "You know you can talk to me, right? I may be an idiot sometimes, but I'm always willing to lend an ear if you need." Alto sighed. "I wouldn't want-" Kai chuckled. "To trouble me? You're the best Medic in town, there isn't much you can do to trouble us, Alto." "I'm not a Medic." Alto said, sighing, but Kai just laughed. "Really? You still think that? You've cured everyone in this town at least once, performed at least two successful surgeries, and devised an honest-to-Arceus wondrous potion that can heal physical injuries without Medic intervention. I'm surprised the Medic's Guild isn't begging you to join in person, honestly." "But Medics don't-" Kai put a hand on Alto's cloud-like plumage, cutting her off again, to her annoyance. "Everyone loses someone. That's sort of inevitable. I lost my parents, Dale his team, and you your Fiancee, but my mother would've been thrilled with where I am now. Dale's done well by his team, from what he's said of them, and I'm confident Treble would've wanted you to continue chasing your dreams. From what you've said of him, he seems a great guy, and he definitely wouldn't want you to mire yourself in doubt and gloom just because he's gone." Alto sighed, preparing her next argument, before Kai cut her off. "Don't mention that you've failed, because you really haven't. It seems like you're perfectly able to pick yourself back up and move onwards in everything except him. I understand, I really do." Kai hugged her neck, awkwardly. "But you can't put yourself down over something that wasn't your fault, Alto. It was just bad luck, and you can't control it. I had to meet Lance before I realized how bad my luck was with those Electricians. Not all of them are bad people, I find." Alto sighed, Kai had been talking to her, trying to egg her back into becoming a Medic, for about a year at this point. "I know you'll likely continue refusing membership, but..." Kai said, walking back to the chair he was sitting on. "Please, consider it. It's clear you'd love being a Medic. We won't collapse without you, either. Sam's actually been fairly competent with house calls, which is why the clinic is this empty today." She nodded, crying softly. It had been empty, but she didn't think it'd been because of Sam. She just assumed nobody had really been sick. Kai noticed she was crying, and handed her a handkerchief, which she used to dab at her eyes. "W- what brought you in, Kai?" She asked, and he nodded. "Besides pestering you about your past, I was wondering if you needed any more potion ingredients." She nodded. "Seaweed, for one, but if you could also manage to find these berries, that'd be great." She handed him a list of berries, mostly ones that had curative properties, and he nodded. "Of course. I'll go grab the seaweed then go hunting for berries." He exited the clinic, leaving her with his words. He had a point, she was being pretty hard on herself. She sighed to herself and fished the Medic's Guild's letter out of the pile of garbage, opening it. It described how she'd have to go to the guildhall to be quizzed on her knowledge, and take classes on portions she wasn't as adept on. She nodded, folding the letter back up and stashing it in the bag she hid in her plumage. She grabbed the portrait of her and Treble, storing it in the same bag, before writing a note explaining what she'd done for Kai and the others, and taking off for Market Town.
