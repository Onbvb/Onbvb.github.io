    // Make a Nonogram

    // What is a Nonogram?
    // Components:
    // Toggleable squares (pixels)
    // Note: Squares need to have behavior for both left and right clicking.
    // Number Hints
    // Note: Need to be aligned with the grid, and have multiple numbers if needed.
    // A method of checking the answer.

    // I will likely go with a hardcoded answer, as itll be less painful.
    // Time to make a JSON object with the hints and grid!
